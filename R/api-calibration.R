#' Portable fixed-calibration capabilities
#'
#' Returns the model and estimator combinations supported by the portable
#' calibration workflow. This matrix concerns saved calibration artifacts;
#' it does not replace the wider fitted-object capabilities of [fit_mfrm()] or
#' [predict_mfrm_units()].
#' For JML fits, fitted-object scoring is post-hoc EAP with a standard-normal
#' reference prior by default, or an explicit `scoring_prior`. It is not
#' ML/WLE scoring or a population distribution estimated by JML. Portable
#' extraction supports RSM/PCM and shared-owner GPCM JML within their distinct
#' source-check scopes. No artifact stores training Person estimates.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per model, estimator, and scoring-basis
#'   combination. `PortableCalibration` is either `"available"` or
#'   `"unavailable"`; the listed scope and source checks still apply.

#' Create and use a portable fixed calibration
#'
#' These functions implement a strict lifecycle for a saved, versioned
#' calibration. [extract_mfrm_calibration()] creates a draft from an eligible
#' `RSM` or `PCM` MML fit under the fixed standard-normal scoring basis, or
#' a GPCM MML fit with an estimated intercept-only normal population that passes
#' the conditional source checks in [predict_mfrm_units()]. RSM/PCM JML also
#' supports portable post-hoc EAP with a standard-normal reference prior.
#' [validate_mfrm_calibration()] and [freeze_mfrm_calibration()] are separate,
#' fail-closed transitions. Only a frozen artifact can be passed to
#' [score_mfrm_calibration()].
#'
#' The portable workflow supports one observed score scale, one latent
#' dimension and known non-Person facet levels. RSM/PCM MML retain stored anchors
#' and two-way facet interactions in file format 1. GPCM uses file format 2,
#' retaining both step and slope owners, positive geometric-mean-one relative
#' slopes and the estimated population mean and SD. The slope multiplies the
#' entire adjacent-category predictor. GPCM currently requires unit weights,
#' no anchors or interactions, and an intercept-only normal population when
#' estimated by MML. Shared-owner GPCM JML uses file format 4 and a post-hoc
#' N(0,1) reference prior; its distinct checks are described below.
#' RSM/PCM JML uses file format 3, with unit weights, no anchors or interactions,
#' a finite identified source and a post-hoc N(0,1) reference prior. This prior
#' is not estimated by JML. Estimated-population RSM/PCM and latent regression
#' use fitted-object routes; other structures follow their documented capabilities.
#' See [mfrm_calibration_capabilities()].
#'
#' GPCM MML extraction freshly evaluates the native fit's local likelihood,
#' gradient, unregularized information and source-integration stability using
#' the same conditional source checks as [predict_mfrm_units()]. A failed or
#' unresolved source cannot be frozen by selecting a review policy. The
#' artifact retains the passing extraction decision, numerical comparison,
#' and original global boundary/identification states. Reading it validates
#' these records against its stored identity; it does not refit the source or
#' claim a global maximum, valid population transport or calibration intervals.
#' Every GPCM scoring call also checks EAP/SD against two adaptive reference
#' orders under the actual scoring prior. Failed score integration stops with
#' `SCORING_INTEGRATION_FAILED`; extract with more `scoring_quad_points` before
#' retrying. Endpoint and sparse-pattern review labels remain separate from
#' numerical accuracy. File format 1 retains its original default semantics.
#'
#' For RSM/PCM MML extraction, run [mml_quadrature_sensitivity()] on user-selected grids
#' and inspect its continuous differences. Pass the exact highest-grid fit in
#' that object together with `quadrature_review`. The retained fits must use
#' their recorded grid sizes and the same data, score map and fitting settings,
#' including anchors and integration mode, and must all have converged.
#' This procedural requirement
#' does not declare the fit numerically stable: the package does not choose the
#' application-specific tolerance or decide whether more grids are needed.
#' Archive the review separately when it is part of the audit trail, because
#' response-linked fits are deliberately not embedded in the portable artifact.
#' GPCM uses the fresh source checks above and does not require an additional
#' refitting study. If supplied, `quadrature_review` is still validated.
#'
#' RSM/PCM JML extraction requires current passing input, identification, category,
#' boundary and numerical checks from the fitted-object scoring policy. It
#' freshly evaluates the joint likelihood and gradient: the stored objective
#' must agree within 1e-6 and the maximum absolute gradient must be <= 1e-4.
#' These are numerical source criteria, not interval-coverage or bias guarantees.
#' Boundary or unresolved sources are refused; there is no review override.
#' No MML quadrature review is used because JML does not integrate over Persons
#' during calibration. Every new JML score batch receives adaptive-reference
#' EAP/SD checks under the actual scoring prior. Increase `scoring_quad_points`
#' on extraction if the scoring grid is inadequate. Source checks and the prior
#' origin persist through saving, loading and score summaries; replay checks
#' the stored evidence without re-estimating the training model.
#'
#' Experimental corrected GPCM JML uses file format 5 and its own source
#' checks. Extraction reconstructs the adjusted equation from the observed
#' ratings and checks the saved root, full equation Jacobian and parameter
#' tables. The maximum mean-equation residual must be <= 1e-7 and the
#' remaining Newton step <= 1e-5. These are numerical checks, not a global
#' uniqueness or bias guarantee. An unavailable covariance does not erase a
#' valid calibration. The artifact records correction order, assignment-sampling
#' assumption, local-root status and numerical checks without training responses
#' or Person estimates. It is never labelled an ordinary JML likelihood maximum.
#' Its EAP and continuous posterior intervals use a separate normal scoring
#' prior; they exclude calibration uncertainty and do not supply corrected
#' Person ML/WLE or structural confidence intervals. Older file formats retain
#' their original checks. See [fit_mfrm()] for corrected estimation limits.
#'
#' For shared-owner uncorrected GPCM JML, extraction checks the joint likelihood and
#' gradient, and positive-definite, unregularized curvature over all free Person
#' and structural parameters (reciprocal condition number > 1e-10). Recorded
#' Person, additive or slope boundary certificates prevent automatic scoring;
#' finite optimizer traces cannot override them. Detected identification failure,
#' inadequate categories, failed numerical checks and unsupported structures
#' also prevent extraction. Otherwise, global identification/boundary audits
#' labelled as incomplete stay incomplete in the artifact. This qualifies
#' conditional EAP only, not global optimality or formal JML slope inference.
#' Source curvature currently uses a dense joint matrix, so its memory cost
#' grows quadratically with the number of free parameters, including Persons.
#' Frozen-artifact scoring does not repeat that calculation or use training data.
#' The objective, gradient and condition-number cutoffs are package numerical
#' criteria, not statistical thresholds established by the scoring literature.
#' A refused source does not imply that all its structural parameters are
#' inestimable: portable scoring does not currently qualify boundary-profile
#' calibrations with infinite training-Person estimates.
#'
#' Posterior EAP estimates, posterior standard deviations, and intervals are
#' conditional on the frozen point calibration and the scoring prior.
#' For GPCM MML, the prior mean and SD estimated during calibration are frozen;
#' a new cohort does not reestimate or replace them. Use `scoring_prior` to
#' examine another shared normal prior without changing the artifact. The
#' original and scoring prior identities remain separate in estimates and
#' settings, including summaries, plot data and exports. A supplied prior is
#' an analyst assumption, not a population estimate. Intervals exclude both
#' population-parameter and calibration-parameter
#' uncertainty. Loading validates structure and semantic consistency, but does
#' not authenticate an artifact from an untrusted source.
#' New v2 scoring algorithms invert the continuous posterior CDF for equal-tail
#' intervals. EAP and SD retain the stored quadrature rule. Saved v1 artifacts
#' preserve their discrete grid interval endpoints and carry a note that the
#' continuous posterior mass can differ from the requested interval level.
#'
#' @section Statistical basis and external comparisons:
#' Bock and Mislevy (1982, pp. 432-433) describe posterior-mean and
#' posterior-SD scoring from fixed response functions and a specified prior,
#' including multiple-category responses. This supports the scoring layer;
#' it does not validate JML calibration bias, the default reference prior for
#' a new cohort, or the numerical tolerances used to check a fitted calibration. Their adaptive
#' testing simulations do not establish coverage for sparse many-facet designs.
#' Muraki (1992) supplies the GPCM model basis and an EM estimation method,
#' not evidence that many-facet JML intervals have accurate coverage.
#'
#' External checks of fixed probabilities, likelihoods and EAP/SD must align
#' the response functions and prior. They do not compare free JML estimation.
#' ConQuest documents that JML cannot estimate item scores (the free scores
#' used for GPCM discrimination). TAM's `tam.jml()` uses a supplied loading
#' array and defaults to extreme-score adjustment and item-bias correction;
#' its default output is not the same estimator as unadjusted JML. Do not
#' infer agreement of estimators from agreement of fixed-calibration scores.

#'
#' @param fit An eligible `mfrm_fit` produced by [fit_mfrm()].
#' @param calibration_id Optional nonempty calibration identifier.
#' @param source_fit_id Optional nonempty source-fit identifier.
#' @param created_at_utc Optional RFC3339 UTC timestamp. Omit it to use the
#'   current time.
#' @param scoring_quad_points Integer quadrature order of at least 2 used for
#'   later artifact scoring. It is independent of the fit-time quadrature and
#'   defaults to 31. The fixed or adaptive integration mode is inherited from
#'   the source fit and stored in the artifact's scoring algorithm identity.
#'   With adaptive scoring, stored nodes and weights define the base Hermite
#'   rule; their person-specific locations are recomputed for each new batch.
#' @param quadrature_review Required for RSM/PCM MML, optional for GPCM MML
#'   (which checks the fitted calibration directly); not used when checking JML fits.
#'   An `mfrm_quadrature_sensitivity` from
#'   [mml_quadrature_sensitivity()] for the same data and model. `fit` must be
#'   the exact highest-grid fit stored in this object. The package checks this
#'   procedural evidence but leaves acceptable numerical movement to the user.
#' @param calibration An `mfrm_calibration` object.
#' @param validated_at_utc,frozen_at_utc Optional RFC3339 UTC timestamps for
#'   reproducible lifecycle records. Omit them to use the current time.
#' @param record_id A nonempty identifier for a terminal superseded or retired
#'   record. It must differ from the frozen parent identifier.
#' @param superseded_at_utc,retired_at_utc Optional RFC3339 UTC timestamps.
#' @param file A path ending in `.rds`.
#' @param overwrite Whether an existing persistence target may be replaced.
#' @param new_data A data frame of response rows for new Persons.
#' @param person,score,weight,event_id Optional input-column names. Stored
#'   source-column names are used when applicable. `event_id` distinguishes
#'   otherwise duplicate response events.
#' @param facets Optional named character vector mapping stored facet names to
#'   input columns.
#' @param interval_level Central posterior interval level, strictly between 0
#'   and 1.
#' @param missing_response Either `"error"` or `"omit"`.
#' @param adaptive_quad_points Optional vector of at least two distinct integer
#'   orders >= 3, for example `c(31, 61)`, used only by
#'   `score_mfrm_calibration()`. Adds an unrounded `quadrature_review` comparing
#'   stored-grid results with mode/curvature-adapted integration for each Person.
#'   Inspect both fixed/adaptive differences and changes between adaptive orders.
#'   This does not change the artifact or replace the reported scores/intervals;
#'   adaptive results condition on the same point calibration.
#'   For GPCM or an explicitly supplied scoring prior, reference orders are
#'   added automatically and the comparison governs numerical score acceptance.
#'   Only Persons with scored responses have numerical review rows. `Status =
#'   "computed"` means the calculation finished, not that accuracy is certified;
#'   an unavailable row retains the reason in `Detail`.
#'
#' @param scoring_prior Optional `list(mean = ..., sd = ...)` for
#'   `score_mfrm_calibration()`. `NULL` retains the artifact's normal prior.
#'   Values use the unchanged calibration scale and must be finite with positive
#'   SD and representable positive variance. A supplied prior automatically
#'   receives numerical scoring checks and does not modify the frozen artifact.
#'   Legacy artifacts with discrete grid-endpoint intervals require re-extraction
#'   before using this option. The prior is common to all scored persons;
#'   covariate-dependent overrides are not supported.
#'
#' @return `extract_mfrm_calibration()`, `validate_mfrm_calibration()`,
#'   `freeze_mfrm_calibration()`, `supersede_mfrm_calibration()`,
#'   `retire_mfrm_calibration()`, and `load_mfrm_calibration()` return an
#'   `mfrm_calibration`. `review_mfrm_calibration()` returns a data frame of
#'   structured refusals, with zero rows for an acceptable object.
#'   `save_mfrm_calibration()` invisibly returns the normalized path.
#'   `score_mfrm_calibration()` returns an `mfrm_calibration_score` containing
#'   estimates plus row and Person dispositions and scoring identities.
#'   When requested and scored rows exist, `quadrature_review` contains the
#'   fixed/adaptive comparison; `summary()` preserves it and adds a compact
#'   `quadrature_overview`.

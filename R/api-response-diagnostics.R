#' Describe fitted response probabilities and residuals
#'
#' Compute response means, variances and descriptive Infit/Outfit summaries.
#' Ordinary and extended RSMs and two-family GPCMs integrate uncertain latent effects; corrected
#' GPCM JML conditions on saved calibration and reprofiled Person estimates.
#' @param fit A numerically ready native RSM MML [fit_mfrm()],
#'   [fit_mfrm_testlet()] or [fit_mfrm_random_rater()] result, a converged
#'   two-family GPCM fixed-grid EM or adaptive direct MML fit, or a shared-owner
#'   GPCM fit with an explicit `jml_correction_order` and an available point solution.
#' @param rows Distinct original input row numbers to return, or `NULL` for
#'   all assigned rows. This selects outputs only: every observed source rating
#'   still informs the joint posterior or saved JML Person profile. Groups
#'   summarize the selected rows; selection does not refit the model.
#' @param group_by Fitted identifier columns to summarize separately. `NULL`
#'   uses all Person, testlet/rater and fixed-facet columns. No grouping by score.
#'   Corrected JML lists the fixed facets first, then Person, so the default
#'   plot shows the first declared facet.
#' @param quad_points Normal quadrature order, 7 to 121 for testlets or 7 to
#'   241 for ordinary RSMs, two-family GPCMs or shared raters. Defaults to the saved fit's order.
#'   Results are checked at `2 * quad_points + 1`;
#'   each category probability must change by no more than `1e-7`.
#'   Omit this argument for corrected JML, which performs no integration.
#' @details Calibration is held fixed. For a posterior replicate rating sharing the
#'   original row's latent effects, the target is
#'   \deqn{p_{ik}=E[P(Y_i^{rep}=k\mid b,\widehat\psi)\mid
#'     Y_{obs},\widehat\psi],}
#'   where b includes ability, and for extensions the local effect or jointly
#'   uncertain shared-rater vector. This uses the same observed data for
#'   estimation and checking; it is not held-out prediction. Define
#'   \deqn{\mu_i=\sum_k k p_{ik},\qquad
#'     V_i=\sum_k (k-\mu_i)^2p_{ik}.}
#'   For these posterior calculations, the mixture variance includes conditional rating variance and
#'   variance of conditional means. Substituting an ability/rater estimate or
#'   averaging conditional variances alone gives a different quantity.
#'
#'   For selected observed unit-weight rows in a group, descriptive Outfit is
#'   the mean of \eqn{(y_i-\mu_i)^2/V_i}; descriptive Infit is
#'   \eqn{\sum_i(y_i-\mu_i)^2/\sum_i V_i}. These summaries have no established
#'   expectation of one. There are no default cutoffs, ZSTD, p-values, automatic
#'   flags or rater-quality classifications. Ordinary plug-in Infit/Outfit
#'   values do not have the same probability definition and must not be
#'   compared directly. No response covariance or calibration uncertainty is
#'   supplied, so these results do not calibrate a formal goodness-of-fit test.
#'
#'   Ordinary RSMs integrate normal ability by quadrature, retaining every
#'   observed rating of the relevant Person. Supported ordinary fits have
#'   unit weights, additive unanchored severity facets, no interactions or
#'   shrinkage, Person as the noncentered facet, consecutive integer source
#'   categories, and either known N(0,1) or `population_formula = ~1`.
#'   The estimated population mean and variance are both retained. This
#'   separate route does not alter the plug-in indices from [diagnose_mfrm()].
#'   Old fits that omitted scores without retaining original row positions
#'   need to be refitted from the complete assigned-score roster.
#'
#'   Testlets use nested normal quadrature. Shared raters use category-specific
#'   Laplace integrals of the complete likelihood times the replicate category
#'   probability, after integrating abilities by quadrature. Each numerator
#'   reoptimizes the joint latent rater mode; calibration is never refitted.
#'   The positive numerator integrals are normalized across categories.
#'   `NormalizationError` records the unnormalized probability sum minus one.
#'   This defect and agreement between quadrature orders are numerical
#'   diagnostics, not bounds on the Laplace approximation error. In particular,
#'   small defects do not certify accuracy with few raters or sparse ratings.
#'   Shared-rater work grows with requested rows and categories; use `rows`
#'   to inspect a subset while retaining the complete conditioning data.
#'
#'   For these posterior routes, missing scores remain `missing_score`; they
#'   are not imputed. Nonfinite
#'   or zero predictive variances and unresolved integration remain unavailable
#'   with a reason. A group containing any unavailable observed row has no
#'   summary, rather than silently dropping that row. Entirely missing groups
#'   have no summary. A fitted zero latent variance defines the corresponding
#'   submodel's predictions; it does not establish absence of heterogeneity.
#'
#' @section Two-family GPCM posterior residuals:
#' Use this route to describe how observed scores differ from the fitted
#' model's posterior predictions. For example, summarize by a Judge column
#' with `mfrm_response_diagnostics(fit, group_by = "Judge")`. Both slope
#' families multiply the complete adjacent-category predictor, as in fitting.
#' Ability is integrated under the fitted fixed N(0,1) population and all of
#' the Person's observed ratings; probabilities are not evaluated at the EAP.
#' Only fitted observed rows are returned, preserving the original identifiers
#' and incomplete assignment pattern. No unassigned cell is filled.
#'
#' The saved solution and point calibration must agree with their fitting
#' specification. A slope covariance or slope interval is not required.
#' Fixed-grid EM and adaptive direct MML retain their respective integration
#' methods. Adaptive grids use the complete Person posterior's mode and curvature,
#' preserving the original N(0,1) prior through density-ratio and Jacobian weights.
#' Source likelihood and engine-specific gradient checks are recomputed before
#' prediction. Stored convergence flags alone do not establish a usable source.
#' This has the same scope as the two-family fit: two fixed slope facets,
#' unit weights, no anchors or covariates, and observed zero-based categories.
#' `quad_points` checks response integration at the retained parameters; it
#' does not refit the calibration. If integration is unresolved, increase it
#' explicitly. The returned probabilities use `2 * quad_points + 1` points;
#' the lower order supplies the row-wise check. Selecting fewer output rows
#' does not shorten the posterior's conditioning record or change its grid.
#' Settings retain the integration method through plots, reports and exports.
#' Separately use [mml_quadrature_sensitivity()] to examine whether
#' the fitted calibration changes across quadrature grids.
#'
#' Inspect `rows` for unavailable predictions before reading `measures`.
#' A larger descriptive Infit or Outfit is not a calibrated misfit decision;
#' there is no expectation-one reference. These same-data summaries neither
#' establish rater quality nor test unidimensionality or local independence.
#' [diagnose_mfrm()], Q3/PCA, Wright/Pathway maps and model ranking retain
#' their separate support restrictions. Attach the saved result with
#' `mfrm_results(fit, include = c("fit", "plots"), compute = "never",
#' response_diagnostics = result)` for plots, reports and exports. Collection
#' and replay do not refit or reintegrate the saved probabilities.
#'
#' @section Corrected JML conditional residuals:
#' For an explicit profile-score-adjusted GPCM fit, probabilities are evaluated
#' at the saved corrected facet/step/slope estimates and the reprofiled Person
#' abilities: \eqn{p_{ik}=P(Y_i=k\mid\widehat\theta_i,\widehat\beta_{adj})}.
#' These are conditional plug-in probabilities, not posterior predictions or
#' held-out predictions. There is no normal ability prior or quadrature.
#' Calibration and Person estimation uncertainty are excluded. Residual bias
#' may remain. Unavailable RootSE does not prevent these point calculations.
#' The response formula is the same shared-owner GPCM used for fitting.
#'
#' Only observed fitted rows are available; no unassigned cells are filled or
#' missing scores imputed. Original row numbers, repeated-event multiplicity,
#' category labels and facet names are retained. `rows` selects displayed and
#' summarized events without changing their Person profiles. Save the result
#' and attach it through `mfrm_results(fit, response_diagnostics = result)`;
#' the saved calibration, slopes, Person profiles and source rows must match.
#'
#' An extreme Person profile has a limiting probability of one at the minimum
#' or maximum score. Its expected score, zero conditional variance and raw
#' residual remain available. `StandardizedResidual` is missing with
#' `Status = "zero_variance"`: the ratio at the saved probabilities is
#' undefined. No automatic convention replacing `0/0` with zero is applied.
#' `ProbabilityAvailable` distinguishes this case from a failed probability
#' calculation. If all selected raw residuals and variances are available and
#' their total variance is positive, Infit remains available, including those
#' zero-variance rows. Outfit requires every selected standardized residual;
#' otherwise it is missing, and the group is `partially_available` with a
#' reason. The grouped `Available` column counts rows with finite standardized
#' residuals; Infit can use all `Observed` rows despite that smaller count.
#' No row is silently discarded. An all-zero-variance group has neither
#' index. Explicitly selecting other rows changes the summarized set and must
#' be reported as such.
#'
#' These same-data residual summaries have no calibrated expectation-one
#' reference, uncertainty intervals, p-values, automatic flags or rater-quality
#' classifications. They do not establish correction of structural bias or
#' replace [diagnose_mfrm()], which is unavailable for this estimator.
#' `plot()` offers paired and scatter views, including [as_ggplot()] conversion.
#' A paired view retains available Infit when Outfit is missing; a scatter view
#' needs both. Reports and exports preserve the probability definition and
#' unavailable outcomes. Corrected-JML model comparison remains unavailable;
#' portable scoring has its own calibration checks and conditional EAP target.
#' @return An `mfrm_response_diagnostics` object with `rows`, category
#'   `probabilities`, grouped `measures`, settings and exact source metadata.
#'   Save with `saveRDS()`; attach via
#'   `mfrm_results(fit, response_diagnostics = result, compute = "never")`.
#'   The resulting `mfrm_results` object contains `tables$response_overview`,
#'   distinguishing available standardized residuals, unresolved calculations,
#'   missing scores, zero-variance rows and source rows not selected. Partial
#'   results require review; availability does not establish model adequacy.
#'   No probabilities or residuals are recomputed for this table.
#'   Older saved `mfrm_results` objects without this table recover the overview
#'   and status from retained diagnostic rows when summarized, reported, exported
#'   or opened in a supported results viewer. The original object is not modified;
#'   newly exported results include the recovered overview and status.
#'   Supply two saved outputs to [compare_mfrm()] for aligned ordinary versus
#'   extended RSM comparisons, using the same selected events and group_by.
#'   Corrected-JML and two-family GPCM comparisons are not supported by that route.
#'   Collecting, plotting and exporting saved results never recomputes integrals.

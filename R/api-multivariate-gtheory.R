#' Multivariate G-study for crossed or nested rating data
#'
#' Estimate observed-score variance-covariance components for fixed score
#' components with one or two common random measurement facets, such as
#' raters, tasks, or occasions. Use balanced ANOVA for a complete design or
#' explicitly select MINQUE(0) for incomplete or unequal observed designs. Conditions
#' have common identities across persons and scores. This is not an MFRM fit.
#'
#' @param data A data frame with at most one row per observed combination of
#'   person and selected facet identifiers. Do not add rows for unassigned
#'   cells or code absent scores as zero.
#' @param scores Names of finite numeric score columns, in the desired order.
#'   A single column is allowed as the univariate special case. Scores are
#'   neither standardized nor converted from category labels.
#' @param person,rater,task Distinct columns identifying persons and facets.
#'   By default both rater and task facets are included. Set `rater = NULL`
#'   for Person-by-Task, or `task = NULL` for Person-by-Rater. At least one
#'   facet is required. Each included factor must have at least two observed levels. Labels
#'   may be character, factor, finite numeric, or logical. Blank or infinite
#'   labels fail; missing labels follow `missing`.
#' @param method `"anova"` (default) requires a complete balanced design.
#'   `"minque0"` estimates the same covariance components from a complete or
#'   incomplete or unequal design using identity-working-covariance MINQUE. Neither
#'   method constrains covariance estimates to be positive semidefinite.
#' @param missing `"error"` (default) refuses missing selected scores or
#'   factor identifiers. `"omit"` explicitly excludes any such row from
#'   every score's analysis and retains exclusion accounting. It does not
#'   impute values or correct missing-data bias. Infinite/nonnumeric scores
#'   are always refused.
#' @param facets Optional character vector selecting one or two common random
#'   facets instead of `rater`/`task`, for example
#'   `c(Rater = "Assessor", Occasion = "Session")`. Values identify data
#'   columns; names label covariance components, D-study count columns, and
#'   plots. An unnamed vector uses the column names as labels. Labels must be
#'   unique and nonblank, contain no `:`, and not use reserved result names
#'   such as `Person`, `Residual`, `Score`, `Scenario`, or plotting fields.
#'   Do not supply `rater` or `task` together with `facets`. `person` and
#'   `scores` remain explicit. `NULL` preserves the task/rater interface.
#' @param nesting Optional named character vector specifying one measurement
#'   facet nested within the other, for example `c(Rater = "Task")`.
#'   The name is the child facet label and the value is its parent label;
#'   with `facets`, use its labels rather than input column names. Persons
#'   remain crossed with these conditions. Child identities are local to each
#'   parent: R1 within Task 1 differs from R1 within Task 2. `NULL` (default)
#'   specifies crossed facets. See "Nested measurement facets" below.
#'
#' @details Every retained cell must have every selected score. Duplicate
#'   cells are not supported. The same identifier (parent/child pair for a
#'   nested child) must denote the same condition across persons and scores.
#'   Equal level counts alone cannot establish that identity or random sampling
#'   from the intended universe.
#'
#'   Choose facets from the intended use of scores: common raters for judging
#'   performances, common tasks for sampling content, or common occasions for
#'   repeat assessments. All selected facets are random and, unless `nesting`
#'   is supplied, fully crossed; `method = "minque0"` permits incomplete observations
#'   of that model. Naming a column Occasion does not model growth, practice,
#'   trends, or serial correlation. Its levels must be defensibly treated as
#'   exchangeable conditions under the stated random-effects assumptions.
#'   Score columns are fixed components of the assessment, not another random
#'   facet. Three or more facets, fixed measurement facets, nesting within
#'   persons, and partial sharing across score components are not supported.
#'
#'   MINQUE(0) models a common mean for each score and independent, zero-mean
#'   random effects with a common covariance matrix for each component. With
#'   intercept-removal matrix `H` and shared-level covariance kernels `K_s`, it
#'   solves `S_st = tr(H K_s H K_t)` against `Q_s = Y' H K_s H Y` for every
#'   score pair. Group-count calculations avoid an observation-by-observation
#'   matrix or a full Cartesian grid. On balanced data it agrees with ANOVA.
#'   It does not optimize a likelihood, fit covariate-dependent means, or
#'   iteratively estimate working covariance weights.
#'
#'   The diagonally scaled moment system must have all eigenvalues above
#'   `sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)` times its largest eigenvalue. Otherwise the
#'   function stops because the components cannot be separated reliably by
#'   these equations. `estimation` retains the rank, scaled eigenvalues,
#'   condition number, and per-component replication counts. These are design
#'   and numerical diagnostics, not precision estimates or model-fit tests.
#'   Graph connectedness alone does not establish component identifiability.
#'   For example, four tasks scored by two distinct raters per performance
#'   and eight tasks scored once have the same per-person workload. Only the
#'   former provides repeated ratings within a Person/Task cell; with one
#'   rating per cell, Person-by-Task and residual variation cannot be separated
#'   in the seven-component model. Other overlaps are still needed for the
#'   remaining components. Uneven workloads across raters can also affect
#'   precision even when the moment system has full rank.
#'
#'   Conditioning on the observed assignments must preserve the stated
#'   random-effect means and covariances. Outcome-dependent assignment or
#'   missingness may violate this assumption; calling missingness MAR does
#'   not correct omitted covariates or selection. Review planned assignments
#'   separately from recorded scores, for example with [describe_mfrm_data()]
#'   and its `expected_design` argument. `design$observed_fraction` uses the
#'   cross-product of retained observed levels for crossed facets, or persons
#'   times the number of observed parent/child pairs for nested facets. It is not an assignment
#'   completion rate and cannot reveal entirely unobserved persons or facets.
#'
#'   With crossed rater and task facets, the seven components are `Person`, `Rater`, `Task`, `Person:Rater`,
#'   `Person:Task`, `Rater:Task`, and `Residual`. With one observation per cell,
#'   `Residual` combines the three-way interaction and within-cell error;
#'   they cannot be separated. With one facet, the three components are
#'   `Person`, the facet, and `Residual`; the last combines Person-by-facet
#'   interaction and within-cell error. Labels supplied in `facets` replace
#'   Rater/Task in these component names. Omitting a facet does not remove its
#'   effects from scores or support generalization to new conditions of that facet. No
#'   scores are averaged automatically. Each component is a matrix whose
#'   diagonal contains variances and whose off-diagonal contains covariances between
#'   scores. For ANOVA, mean products replace the mean squares used for a
#'   single score.
#'
#'   Raw component estimates, including negative variances and indefinite
#'   matrices, are retained without clipping or nearest-PSD repair. The
#'   `component_diagnostics` assess eigenvalues after scaling by the observed
#'   score SDs, using a relative numerical tolerance. This is a numerical
#'   admissibility check, not a significance test or precision assessment.
#'   Rank-deficient components are reported. [mfrm_multivariate_d_study()]
#'   retains raw projected variances and evaluates each score/composite and
#'   metric separately. A non-PSD component does not automatically withhold
#'   coefficients: for example, Rater-by-Task does not enter relative error.
#'   D-study tables and plots flag non-PSD components even when a requested
#'   projection can be calculated. Inspect these diagnostics before using it.
#'   Non-PSD estimates can arise from sampling variation even under a correctly
#'   specified model, particularly when a true component is small or zero.
#'   They do not by themselves prove bad data, informative missingness, or
#'   model misspecification. Automatic clipping or deleting a component would
#'   change the estimation procedure and is not performed.
#'   Distinguish `estimation$rank`, the number of separable components, from
#'   `component_diagnostics$Rank`, the rank of each between-score covariance
#'   matrix. A true zero covariance component can have matrix rank zero
#'   while the design still separates that component from the others.
#'
#'   The model concerns numeric observed scores. Treating ordered categories
#'   as numeric does not estimate latent ordinal or MFRM reliability. The
#'   mGENOVA Appendix E example checks balanced numerical calculations;
#'   MINQUE(0) additionally agrees with direct covariance-kernel calculations
#'   for incomplete designs. These checks do not establish population recovery
#'   for arbitrary sparse assignments or missingness mechanisms. This function
#'   returns point estimates, not sampling intervals.
#'
#' @section Fixed tasks as score components:
#'   To plan ratings of the same fixed interview, presentation and discussion,
#'   put the three task scores in separate columns and use `task = NULL`.
#'   Each row is one Person/Rater pair; the same rater and person identities
#'   must apply to every task column. The tasks and prespecified score weights
#'   define the fixed composite. Only raters are sampled measurement conditions.
#'   Different task-specific rater teams do not satisfy this representation.
#'
#'   The Person covariance includes stable Person-by-fixed-task differences.
#'   For weight vector `w` and `n_r` planned raters, universe variance is
#'   `w' P w`, relative error is `w' E w / n_r`, and absolute error is
#'   `w' (R + E) w / n_r`. These match a univariate Person-by-Rater analysis
#'   of the directly weighted task score. Do not average task-specific
#'   reliability coefficients or additionally divide error by the task count.
#'   Each planned rater scores every fixed task. Two raters for three fixed
#'   tasks require six ratings per person, not two or three.
#'
#'   MINQUE(0) permits identifiable incomplete Person/Rater source designs;
#'   every retained row still needs all task scores. Explicit `missing = "omit"`
#'   removes a whole incomplete score vector. Do not impute unassigned tasks
#'   to manufacture common score identities. The D-study projects a future
#'   complete common-rater design; it does not estimate sparse-roster reliability.
#'   Adding or replacing tasks, partial rater sharing and an arbitrary mixture
#'   of fixed/random facets are not implemented by this representation. Holding
#'   the task count constant in a random-task model is a different assumption.
#'
#' @section Nested measurement facets:
#'   Suppose each task has its own rater team, and each team rates the same
#'   persons on both Content and Organization. Use `nesting = c(Rater = "Task")`
#'   for Person crossed with Rater-within-Task. The five components are
#'   `Person`, `Task`, `Rater(Task)`, `Person:Task`, and `Residual`. The last
#'   combines Person-by-Rater-within-Task interaction and within-cell error.
#'   There is no separately estimated common Rater or Rater-by-Task component.
#'   A rater who actually works across tasks is not an independent nested
#'   rater; changing their identifier cannot establish independence.
#'
#'   ANOVA requires all persons at every observed parent/child combination
#'   and the same number of children per parent. MINQUE(0) also permits missing
#'   cells and unequal child counts when its moment equations separate the
#'   five components. Having only one child per parent confounds parent and
#'   child components. Neither method corrects informative assignments.
#'
#'   `design$counts["Rater"]` is the total number of distinct task/rater
#'   pairs; `design$child_counts` gives the rater count within each task.
#'   `design$levels` retains the original labels, interpreted locally for the
#'   child facet. A design is `complete` when every person has every observed
#'   nested condition, and `balanced` when it also has equal child counts.
#'   In a future D-study, `Raters` instead means raters per task: two raters
#'   for each of six tasks use twelve distinct raters and twelve ratings per
#'   person. Future designs preserve this nesting and have equal child counts.
#'   Other two-facet names and the opposite nesting direction follow the same
#'   rules; nesting within persons and score-specific child identities do not.
#'
#' @section Reviewing incomplete designs:
#'   Begin with the planned roster and `data_usage` to distinguish unassigned
#'   cells from missing assigned ratings. Then inspect `estimation` for
#'   component separation and replication, `component_diagnostics` for
#'   covariance admissibility, and the D-study metric-specific status columns
#'   (`GStatus`, `PhiStatus`, `RelativeSEMStatus`, `AbsoluteSEMStatus`) before
#'   reading the corresponding result. None of these checks estimates sampling
#'   precision or identifies the missingness mechanism. No fixed percentage of observed cells,
#'   condition-number cutoff, or passed matrix check establishes adequate
#'   precision. D-studies project future complete balanced designs. The separate
#'   [mfrm_multivariate_d_compare()] offers approximate normal-theory intervals
#'   for prespecified differences in two-facet crossed designs; nested-design
#'   intervals are not currently available.
#'
#'   For the same rating workload, changing rater overlap or concentrating
#'   assignments can change estimation precision. Omitting ratings selected
#'   by their scores can introduce bias even when every requested coefficient
#'   is calculable. Neither a returned coefficient nor agreement with another
#'   program determines whether these assumptions suit the user's assessment.
#'   Observed pool sizes concern estimation in the G-study; they differ from
#'   the per-person counts in a future D-study scenario. Review which tasks
#'   and raters are shared and whether recorded ratings represent the intended
#'   population and conditions before interpreting a projected improvement.

#' Plan measurement conditions with a multivariate D-study
#'
#' Would adding tasks or raters make assessment scores more dependable?
#' Use an estimated G-study to compare specified future designs for individual
#' score components and optional weighted composites. Each scenario reports
#' dependability and measurement error for mean scores over common random
#' measurement conditions, such as tasks, raters, or occasions. No model is refitted.
#'
#' @param x A result from [mfrm_multivariate_gstudy()].
#' @param design_grid A nonempty data frame with one positive integer count
#'   column per G-study facet. With the `rater`/`task` interface, use `Raters`
#'   and/or `Tasks` for the included facets. With `facets`, use its exact
#'   labels, for example `Rater` and `Occasion` for
#'   `facets = c(Rater = "Assessor", Occasion = "Session")`. The mapping is
#'   available in `x$design$count_columns`.
#'   Each row is one future complete balanced design preserving the G-study's
#'   crossed or nested structure. For `nesting = c(Rater = "Task")`, `Raters`
#'   means raters per task, not the total rater pool. `NULL` uses the G-study
#'   counts (children per parent for a nested facet) only when its retained
#'   data are complete and balanced; incomplete or unequal designs require an
#'   explicit grid. Counts need not match or exceed the G-study counts.
#'   Conditions are shared across persons and scores in every scenario.
#' @param weights Optional named numeric vector for one composite, or a numeric
#'   matrix for several named composites. A vector must name every original
#'   score exactly once; matrix rows must name every score exactly once, and
#'   columns must have unique, nonempty composite names. Rows are matched by
#'   name, regardless of order. Every weight must be finite and each composite
#'   must have at least one nonzero weight. Signed weights allow difference
#'   scores, for example `c(Content = 1, Organization = -1)`. Weights are used
#'   as supplied, without normalization. `NULL` reports original scores only.
#'   Otherwise, each scenario reports the original scores once, followed by
#'   each composite. A vector's composite is named `"Composite"`; a matrix
#'   preserves its column names and order.
#'
#' @details Start with a concrete comparison, such as six versus twelve tasks
#'   for every examinee. Each row of `design_grid` is one scenario. With both
#'   facets, `data.frame(Raters = c(2, 4), Tasks = c(3, 3))` compares two versus
#'   four raters at three tasks; `expand.grid(Raters = c(2, 4),
#'   Tasks = c(3, 6))` requests all four combinations. These counts apply to
#'   every person and score, not to the total number of observed ratings.
#'   For `facets = c(Rater = "Assessor", Occasion = "Session")`, use
#'   `expand.grid(Rater = c(1, 2), Occasion = c(2, 4))`. The same workflow
#'   applies to any supported one- or two-facet model; extra columns cannot
#'   introduce conditions absent from the G-study.
#'
#'   Read `summary(d)` together with `plot(d)`:
#'   * `G` concerns consistency of relative ordering, such as ranking examinees.
#'   * `Phi` concerns absolute score levels and also counts shifts from easier
#'     tasks or more lenient raters as error. It is not pass/fail accuracy.
#'   * `RelativeSEM` and `AbsoluteSEM` express these errors in the units of the
#'     mean score or composite. Smaller SEMs mean less error. They are not
#'     confidence intervals for G or Phi.
#'
#'   Larger G/Phi and smaller SEM indicate greater dependability under the
#'   model. There is no universally acceptable coefficient: consider the use
#'   of scores, consequences of error, and workload before choosing a design.
#'   Compare a chosen score/composite and metric across feasible plans. For
#'   example, `data.frame(Raters = c(2, 3, 4), Tasks = c(6, 4, 3))` holds the
#'   number of ratings per person at twelve. It does not hold examinee task
#'   burden or total cost constant. The largest projected coefficient is a
#'   point-estimate ranking, not evidence that one plan is reliably better.
#'   Consider the size of the projected difference and which differences
#'   would matter for the assessment. Small rank changes need not imply large
#'   practical losses. If a metric is unavailable for any candidate, comparing
#'   only the remaining values does not resolve the full planning question.
#'   `plot(d, type = "sem")` shows the SEMs. Plots select a sole composite
#'   by default, or the first score when there are no composites. With several
#'   composites, specify one with `plot(d, composite = "Equal")`; use
#'   `plot(d, score = "V")` to inspect an original score named V. The title
#'   always identifies the plotted score and any composite weights.
#'   Check `GStatus`, `PhiStatus`, `RelativeSEMStatus`, and `AbsoluteSEMStatus`:
#'   each explains the corresponding metric's availability. `NA` means
#'   unavailable, not zero dependability. `ComponentPSD` separately flags
#'   covariance components needing review. See [plot.mfrm_multivariate_d_study()] for
#'   interpreting curves and unavailable estimates.
#'
#' @section Calculation and interpretation limits:
#'   For crossed covariance component matrices `P`, `R`, `T`, `PR`, `PT`, `RT`,
#'   and `E`, universe-score covariance is `P`. Relative-error covariance is
#'   `PR/n_r + PT/n_t + E/(n_r*n_t)`. Absolute-error covariance adds
#'   `R/n_r + T/n_t + RT/(n_r*n_t)`. The G-study number of persons does not
#'   divide individual-score universe variance. Holding a count constant does
#'   not turn its random facet into a fixed facet.
#'   For a Person-by-Task G-study, `E` combines Person-by-Task interaction and
#'   within-cell error: relative-error covariance is `E/n_t`, absolute-error
#'   covariance is `(T + E)/n_t`, and universe-score covariance remains `P`.
#'   The same formulas apply to a Person-by-Rater design or to facets selected
#'   by `facets`, with names replaced in the declared order. For a single
#'   facet F and its planned count n, relative error is `E/n` and absolute
#'   error is `(F + E)/n`. A D-study cannot introduce an absent facet.
#'   For fixed tasks represented by score columns in a Person-by-Rater model,
#'   vary only `Raters`. The task set remains fixed, and each planned rater
#'   scores all tasks. See "Fixed tasks as score components" in
#'   [mfrm_multivariate_gstudy()] for the target and allocation requirements.
#'
#'   For raters nested within tasks, use the five components `P`, `T`,
#'   `R(T)`, `PT`, and `E`, where `E` includes the Person-by-Rater-within-Task
#'   interaction. With `n_r` raters per task and `n_t` tasks, relative error is
#'   `PT/n_t + E/(n_r*n_t)`; absolute error adds `T/n_t + R(T)/(n_r*n_t)`.
#'   Universe covariance remains `P`. Other nested facet labels follow the
#'   same rules. All persons receive the same tasks and their nested raters;
#'   two raters per task at six tasks means twelve distinct raters, not two
#'   raters each judging six tasks. Future unequal child counts, changes of
#'   nesting, and nested-design sampling intervals are not supported.
#'
#'   For incomplete source data, counts of distinct observed levels are not
#'   per-person replication counts. This function projects a future complete
#'   design; it does not estimate the reliability of the observed sparse
#'   roster, heterogeneous person-specific assignments, or averages of them.
#'
#'   Each score uses diagonal entries; a composite uses `w' Sigma w` for each
#'   of the three covariance matrices. Thus between-score covariance affects
#'   composite dependability. `G = UniverseVariance / (UniverseVariance +
#'   RelativeErrorVariance)` and `Phi` uses absolute error instead. SEMs are
#'   square roots of the corresponding error variances, in the units of the
#'   score or specified composite of mean scores. Multiplying all weights by
#'   a nonzero constant multiplies SEMs by its absolute value but leaves G/Phi
#'   unchanged. Weights express a substantive choice; this function neither
#'   chooses them nor identifies an optimal design. Interpret a difference
#'   only when subtraction is meaningful on the supplied score scales.
#'   Comparing several composites holds the estimated components and planned
#'   designs constant, but different weights may change the construct being
#'   assessed. A higher coefficient alone does not justify that change.
#'   Compare SEMs across composites only when their scales are comparable.
#'
#'   The same weights define the universe-score composite and its observed
#'   mean-score estimate (the equal WWTS/AWTS case in mGENOVA). Different
#'   target and estimation weights, profile reliability, and accuracy at a
#'   cut score are not provided. Unlike mGENOVA's default D-study procedure,
#'   negative variance estimates are not replaced with zero. mGENOVA replaces
#'   negative variance components with zero for the D-study unless its
#'   `NEGATIVE` option is selected (manual, pages 15 and 21). That rule concerns
#'   variances, not all negative covariances, and does not guarantee PSD
#'   component matrices.
#'   Do not transfer that option's meaning to jGENOVA: its `NEGATIVE` option
#'   controls printing of negative estimates. jGENOVA's D-study zeroes negative
#'   variances with either `ALGORITHM` or its default `EMS` convention; `EMS`
#'   also recalculates other components using the zero replacements. Matching
#'   a raw G-study estimate therefore need not give matching default D-studies.
#'   These conventions are not selectable estimation options in this function.
#'
#'   Raw covariance matrices and projected variances remain available. G
#'   requires nonnegative universe and relative-error variances and a positive
#'   sum; Phi uses absolute-error variance instead. Each SEM requires only its
#'   corresponding nonnegative error variance. A failed requirement makes
#'   only that metric `NA`. Zero universe variance yields a coefficient of
#'   zero when its error variance is positive; a zero total variance leaves
#'   the coefficient undefined. No estimates are clipped or replaced.
#'
#'   `Status` summarizes a row as `"Available"`, `"Partially available"`, or
#'   `"Unavailable"`; the four metric-specific status columns give the reasons.
#'   `ComponentPSD` is TRUE only when all G-study component matrices pass
#'   their numerical PSD check. A FALSE value flags components for review
#'   without suppressing otherwise calculable projections. Print and plot
#'   methods display a note for non-PSD components. Calculability does not
#'   validate the joint covariance model or establish precise estimation;
#'   inspect `component_diagnostics` before interpreting estimates. Raw estimates
#'   can yield `Phi > G` when projected absolute error is less than relative
#'   error. Under the stated model, the extra absolute-error contributions
#'   are nonnegative; such a reversal calls for review of the estimated
#'   components, not a conclusion that absolute decisions are more dependable.
#'   Passing the matrix checks does not establish model fit. Outputs are
#'   point projections conditional on the estimated components, without
#'   confidence intervals, missing-data correction, or MFRM latent inference.

# Shared random raters: feedback and replacement raters

An assessment coordinator wants feedback for the raters who marked this
year’s performances and wants to understand what could happen when other
raters are recruited. These are different questions. A fixed-rater MFRM
describes the particular raters. A random-rater model additionally
assumes that these raters are draws from a specified population. That
assumption needs a substantive justification: a hand-picked panel is not
automatically representative.

The same issue arises for music juries, clinical performance assessments
and sports judges. Changing the names of the columns is straightforward;
deciding whether the population, assignment and scoring assumptions fit
the setting is essential. This workflow currently uses an
adjacent-category rating scale model (RSM), unit weights and additive
fixed facets.

The crossed-effects rationale is related to [Van den Noortgate, De Boeck
and Meulders (2003)](https://doi.org/10.3102/10769986028004369). Their
binary model shares each random effect across all responses involving
that unit. [Huang and Cai
(2024)](https://doi.org/10.3102/10769986231193351) model crossed effects
for item-level ordinal ratings with a graded-response model. These
papers explain why sharing matters; they do not establish equivalence to
this RSM or validate its numerical approximation and intervals.

## Fit the shared-rater model

Install the optional `RTMB` package (version 2.0 or later) to fit this
model and to score responses and compute profile intervals. Saved
summaries, plots and point predictions do not require a live optimizer.
The examples below run when RTMB is available.

``` r
ratings <- load_mfrmr_data("example_core")
random_fit <- fit_mfrm_random_rater(
  ratings, person = "Person", rater = "Rater", score = "Score",
  facets = "Criterion", score_levels = 1:4, quad_points = 121
)

These demonstration data contain 48 persons, four raters and four
criteria. Four raters can illustrate the calculations, but provide
little information about an entire rater population. Adding ratings from
the same four raters does not create more independent draws from that
population.

Each person has one latent ability, and each rater has one severity
effect shared across **all persons rated by that rater**. Drawing a
fresh rater effect for every person would describe a different
dependence structure. Abilities are independent normal with mean zero
and estimated SD; severities are independent normal with mean zero and
estimated SD, independent of abilities and assignment. Fixed-facet level
effects sum to zero. Steps are unconstrained adjacent thresholds, and
their mean determines overall location. The observed raters’ severities
are not forced to sum to zero.

The default `person_sd = NULL` estimates the ability population’s SD. It
is reported separately from rater population variation:

``` r
random_fit$calibration[c("person_sd", "person_variance", "rater_sd")]
#> $person_sd
#> [1] 0.9686796
#> 
#> $person_variance
#> [1] 0.9383402
#> 
#> $rater_sd
#> [1] 0.2540321
```

Set `person_sd = 1` to impose a known standard normal population, or
supply another positive known SD. With the Rasch slope fixed at one,
fixing ability variance is a substantive restriction: a population twice
as dispersed cannot be represented simply by relabeling the same fitted
scale. The mean remains zero; the step location is free. Estimating a
common SD does not accommodate different ability populations across
panels. Connecting such panels with a few common persons does not
establish a homogeneous population or ignorable assignment. Earlier
saved fits retain their original known standard normal population.

Fixed-facet and step calibration tables retain estimates and approximate
SEs, but bounds are omitted by default. To inspect a pointwise normal
approximation explicitly, use:

``` r

This does not request intervals for the observed raters or population
SDs. Finite-sample coverage is not established. For tables, reports and
exports, use
`mfrm_results(random_fit, calibration_intervals = "normal", calibration_level = .95)`.
Rebuilding output from an older saved fit applies the new default
without refitting; older result bundles keep their stored tables.

Both estimated zero variances are checked explicitly. At either
estimated boundary, regular calibration and rater intervals are
unavailable. An estimated ability variance at the upper search bound
also prevents numerical readiness; inspect
`PersonVarianceUpperBoundary`, increase `person_variance_max` and refit
before interpretation. The default bound of 16 is a search limit, not
evidence that larger population variances are impossible.

The fit uses frequentist approximate marginal maximum likelihood, with
no priors on calibration or variance parameters. Person effects are
integrated with quadrature conditional on the shared raters; a Laplace
approximation integrates the joint rater vector. [Kristensen et
al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v070.i05) describe the
automatic differentiation and Laplace framework.

`NumericalReady` compares the chosen Person quadrature with a higher
order and checks optimization. This example uses 121 points because
lower orders were insufficient for its response vectors. Up to 241
points can be requested; no order is universally adequate, especially
when ability variance is large. `InformationPositive` additionally
checks usable local curvature. A separated facet can have a tiny
gradient as its coefficient diverges; that does not make it a finite,
identified solution. Failed numerical or information checks block
prediction and profiling, and withhold regular intervals. These checks
do **not** test the separate rater Laplace approximation, establish
model fit, or guarantee interval coverage. If a check fails, inspect it
and resolve the numerical issue before prediction or profiling.

For a failed `PersonQuadratureStable` check, refit the same data with a
larger `quad_points`. For example, after an insufficient 61-point fit,
keep that fit and try 121 points with the same model and population
settings:

``` r
refined <- fit_mfrm_random_rater(
  ratings, "Person", "Rater", "Score", facets = "Criterion",
  score_levels = 1:4, person_sd = NULL, quad_points = 121
)
refined$checks
```

Match the arguments to your original fit: changing a known `person_sd`
to `NULL`, for example, changes the model as well as the computation.
The `LogLikDifference` and `GradientDifference` compare integration
orders at the fitted calibration; the higher-order check alone does not
reestimate the parameters. A successful refit must pass optimization,
integration and information checks, while an estimated zero variance
retains its own interval restrictions. If 241 points still fail, the
computation remains unresolved. Do not change the recorded checks to
obtain intervals from the earlier fit.

### How accurate is the calibration likelihood near the estimate?

The fit uses Person quadrature and a shared-rater Laplace approximation.
Increasing the Person quadrature order checks one numerical integration;
it does not measure the error of the separate rater approximation. An
independent comparison reused eight three-category datasets with 240
Persons, six or 24 raters, and rotating pairs or weakly linked panels.
It moved all six calibration coordinates, a criterion contrast and the
two population SDs along directions scaled to one local information
unit. Calibration was held at each planned point; no alternative model
was fitted.

All 144 planned likelihood-change comparisons met the stated tolerance
of **0.05 log-likelihood units**, including Monte Carlo uncertainty.
They contain 128 distinct parameter points: the named criterion-contrast
direction repeats one basis direction. The largest absolute difference
from the refined reference was 0.005 log-likelihood units; the largest
error allowance was 0.0071. These are numerical tolerances, not logits
or assessment cutoffs.

The initial importance-sampling reference left 61 comparisons unresolved
because of reference precision or its uncertainty allowance. A second,
predeclared calculation transformed the same saved joint posterior draws
and included the exact change-of-variables determinant. This reduced
reference noise without changing the target integral, parameter points,
package likelihood or tolerance. It was applied to all points, and the
initial results remain recorded. It was not a new sampling run or an
independent replication.

This supports the tested **local likelihood changes**. It does not
establish an exact maximum-likelihood solution, absolute likelihood
normalization, accuracy along an entire refitted SD profile, or behavior
at a zero-variance boundary. It also does not establish interval
coverage. Fixed-facet and step intervals remain observed-information
normal approximations; the rater-SD profile and conditional Person
intervals have the separate meanings below.

![Conditional-mode severity estimates for four observed raters relative
to the assumed population mean. Positive values indicate stricter
ratings. The default shows points without interval bounds or quality
classifications.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/severity-1.png)

Positive severity means stricter ratings relative to the assumed rater
population mean. Points are conditional modes, with shrinkage toward
that mean. `ConditionalSD` describes uncertainty holding calibration
fixed. `PredictionSE` additionally incorporates first-order calibration
uncertainty. The full `rater_covariance` retains dependence between
raters. Neither number establishes the coverage of an interval.

Individual-rater `Lower` and `Upper` are missing by default, and the
default plot shows points only. Nominal interval coverage has not been
established. If an approximate interval is useful for investigating the
calculation, request it explicitly from the saved fit:

``` r
normal_approximation <- confint(random_fit, parm = "raters")
normal_approximation
#>           Lower      Upper
#> R01 -0.45298058 0.13221318
#> R02 -0.56599448 0.02754621

#> attr(,"note")
#> [1] "Nominal coverage is not established. Explicit approximation only; not a rater-quality classification or a rater-difference interval."
# Optional display: plot(random_fit, intervals = "normal")
```

These are first-order normal prediction intervals for the **realized
random rater effects**, not confidence intervals for fixed-rater
coefficients. Their coverage can be poor with few raters, sparse panels,
an inaccurate approximation or a wrong population model. They do not
classify rater quality. Discuss specific ratings and rubric
interpretation before considering any intervention; severity alone does
not establish inconsistency, bias against a group or a need to exclude a
rater. Existing
[`diagnose_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/diagnose_mfrm.md)
and fixed-facet interval helpers do not accept this distinct model
class.

## Choose a view and adapt its presentation

For feedback, start with severity points and concrete examples of
ratings. The explicitly selected normal approximation can be inspected
in a precision view; its vertical axis is the **approximate interval
width**, not validated precision, Infit, reliability or a quality score.
The cumulative distribution summarizes the observed point estimates.
Shrinkage and which raters were included affect that distribution, so it
is not an estimate of the latent rater population. Four raters make a
small descriptive example.

``` r
plot(random_fit, style = "precision", intervals = "normal", point_size = 3,
     title = "Rater severity and approximate interval width")
```

![Four observed rater estimates plotted against explicitly requested
approximate interval width. Saved plot data provide the exact estimates
and bounds; nominal coverage is not
established.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/severity-precision-1.png)

``` r
plot(random_fit, style = "distribution", reference = NULL,
     title = "Distribution of the observed rater estimates")
```

![Empirical cumulative distribution of four observed rater estimates.
The shaded step curve describes point estimates, not a latent population
distribution.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/severity-distribution-1.png)

The same views work for saved Person scores and testlet fixed-facet
estimates. `sort = "estimate"` or `sort = "uncertainty"` reorders an
interval plot without altering the source table. For rater fits, sorting
by interval width also requires `intervals = "normal"`. It does not test
differences between rows. `palette = "mono"` supports black-and-white
reproduction. Open and filled symbols distinguish prior-only and
response-based scores, independently of colour. Prior-only scores are
omitted from cumulative distributions. Precision views omit rows without
finite intervals. Every omitted row and reason remains in
`plot_data(figure)$display_data`; the complete source is in `$table`.

For a publication with its own caption, suppress the built-in text:

``` r
figure <- plot(random_fit, draw = FALSE, sort = "estimate", palette = "mono",
               show_title = FALSE, show_notes = FALSE, text_scale = 1.15)
if (requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) print(as_ggplot(figure))
```

```

`title` and `caption` accept replacement text; `""` removes it.
`show_labels = FALSE` removes individual IDs in interval and precision
views, which can help with crowded figures. `reference = NULL` removes
the vertical reference line; `text_scale` and `point_size` adjust size.
The reference is an orientation aid, not a decision threshold.
Interpretation notes remain available even when hidden. Explain the
interval target in your figure caption or surrounding text.

[`as_ggplot()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/as_ggplot.md)
preserves these choices and adds an alternative description via
`labs(alt = ...)`; use standard
[`ggplot2::labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html)
and `theme()` for axis labels, fonts and further layout changes. Supply
a textual description and table when publishing an image: the image file
alone does not expose its stored metadata to a screen reader. Bootstrap
interval comparisons also support the display controls and ggplot
conversion, retaining dashed ordinary intervals and arrows for unbounded
bootstrap endpoints. They keep the interval view.

## Compare the same observed panel with fixed raters

The practical question is how changing rater treatment changes the
fitted severity summaries for **the same ratings**. Fit the ordinary
reference with the same common normal population assumption.
`population_formula = ~1` estimates its ability SD; the ordinary RSM
default instead fixes N(0,1).

``` r
ordinary_fit <- fit_mfrm(
  ratings, person = "Person", facets = c("Rater", "Criterion"), score = "Score",
  model = "RSM", method = "MML", rating_min = 1, rating_max = 4,
  keep_original = TRUE, population_formula = ~1,
  person_data = unique(ratings["Person"]), quad_points = 121
)
```

``` r
model_comparison <- compare_mfrm(
  ordinary_fit, random_fit, labels = c("Fixed raters", "Shared random raters")
)

![Fixed versus shared random rater effects, centered over the same
observed panel. Points show descriptive changes relative to the equality
line; no difference intervals or model preference are
shown.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/model-comparison-1.png)

Each model’s rater estimates are centered at the unweighted mean over
the same observed panel. This preserves pairwise rater contrasts while
removing arbitrary origins. The raw values and subtracted centers remain
in the table. `Difference` is the second model minus the first.
Random-rater points are conditional modes, whereas the ordinary points
are fixed-effect estimates: shrinkage toward the center does not
establish greater accuracy or justify excluding a rater. The ordinary
model’s wider inferential-readiness status is also retained, even when
descriptive numerical checks pass.

Use `style = "difference"` for differences against their means, or
`as_ggplot(plot(model_comparison, draw = FALSE))` for custom styling.
The comparison uses saved fits and does not refit, score or resample. It
provides no intervals for model differences, AIC/BIC preference or
ordinary chi-squared variance-component test. Person scores,
replacement-rater predictions and predictive fit statistics require
separately aligned targets and are not compared by this facet table.

Checks include repeated-event multiplicity, categories, unit weights,
fixed facets, population assumptions and omitted-score identities. New
ordinary fits save excluded events in `prep$omitted_data`. An older fit
with omissions but no such provenance must be refitted from the complete
assigned roster; matching row counts alone are insufficient. The
comparison supports missing assigned scores, not missing IDs or excluded
weights. Unsupported constraints or mismatched data are refused even
with `warn_constraints = FALSE`.

## What the bounded validation shows

With **estimated ability SD**, a prespecified study used 240 Persons,
three criteria and two raters per Person (1,440 responses), with 200
independent datasets per condition. Abilities were N(0,1.3²), rater
effects N(0,0.7²), and scores 0–2. Rotating adjacent pairs were compared
with two half-panels joined by only two bridging Persons. Per-rater
workload was held equal within each rater count. Both models estimated
ability variance; the shared-rater fit used 61-point Person quadrature
with its higher-order check.

| Raters | Assignment | Finite intervals / planned | Conditional coverage | 95% Monte Carlo interval |
|---:|----|---:|---:|---:|
| 6 | Rotating | 198/200 | 91.58% | 88.77–94.39% |
| 6 | Weakly linked | 198/200 | 91.84% | 88.99–94.68% |
| 24 | Rotating | 176/200 | 94.06% | 93.18–94.94% |
| 24 | Weakly linked | 174/200 | 93.99% | 93.08–94.90% |

Coverage targets realized **uncentered** rater effects. It is first
averaged within each dataset; the dataset is the independent Monte Carlo
unit. These Monte Carlo intervals describe simulation precision, not an
interval for one assessment. Missing intervals are excluded only from
conditional coverage, and remain in the planned availability
denominator. The proportion both available and covering was 90.67%,
90.92%, 82.77% and 81.77%, respectively.

All optimizers converged and information checks passed. Higher-order
Person quadrature checks failed in 2, 1, 24 and 26 datasets in the
table’s order; one additional six-rater weak-design fit estimated zero
rater variance. No failed result was replaced. These checks do not
assess rater Laplace error.

**No condition met the combined qualification criterion.** The study
required the lower 95% Monte Carlo coverage bound to be at least 92.5%,
the coverage estimate no greater than 97.5%, and the lower exact
availability bound to be at least 95%. Six-rater uncertainty was also
too wide to conclude coverage below the prespecified 92.5%
material-undercoverage floor. The correct decision is inconclusive, not
proof of equivalence or a new definitive failure. Increasing replication
after seeing these outcomes was not part of the plan.

On the same available datasets, shared-rater point estimates had lower
**sample-centered** rater MSE than ordinary MFRM with 24 raters (about
.075 versus .094 for rotating pairs and .077 versus .097 for weak
linking). Six-rater MSE differences were inconclusive. This comparison
uses a different target from the uncentered intervals and does not
establish overall model superiority. Six-rater mean population-SD
estimates were about .622 instead of .7; the Monte Carlo bias intervals
crossed the prespecified 10% tolerance. The study does not isolate the
causes of these results.

Consequently, automatic individual-rater normal intervals are withdrawn.
`confint(fit, parm = "raters")` and `plot(fit, intervals = "normal")`
preserve explicit access to the approximation; neither corrects it. New
summaries, plots and reports of earlier saved fits follow this default,
without changing the saved object or refitting. Raw older objects and
already saved plot data retain their historical values. Bootstrap
intervals are not promoted as a validated replacement. Numerical
integration, retained uncertainty and the Laplace approximation still
need qualification; no minimum rater count is established. This study
does not qualify Person intervals or the testlet model.

### Earlier fixed-population evidence

A normal-population pilot used 240 persons, three fixed criteria and two
rotating adjacent raters per person: 1,440 ratings in each dataset. It
crossed six or 24 raters with true rater population SD zero or 0.7, with
40 independent datasets per condition. Abilities were generated as
N(0,1) and their SD was fixed as known at one during fitting. These
results apply to that restricted branch; they do not qualify the default
estimated ability-SD workflow. Every fit passed its numerical and
information checks; every population-SD profile interval was available.
This did not make all nominal 95% intervals accurate. Under true SD 0.7:

| Raters | Mean estimated population SD | SD intervals containing 0.7 | Individual-rater interval coverage |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 6 | 0.640 | 37/40 (92.5%) | 84.2% |
| 24 | 0.690 | 39/40 (97.5%) | 94.4% |

Individual-rater coverage was averaged within each dataset, then across
the 40 independent datasets. Its Monte Carlo SE was 4.6 and 1.0
percentage points, respectively; the individual raters were not counted
as independent simulation replications. Exact 95% Monte Carlo intervals
for population-SD coverage were 79.6–98.4% and 86.8–99.9%. Forty
replications cannot establish precise nominal coverage, and this
comparison changes both rater count and workload/linking. It does not
establish a minimum adequate rater count.

Under true SD zero, all 40 profile intervals in each condition contained
zero. The fitted variance was on the boundary in 29/40 six-rater
datasets and 19/40 24-rater datasets. Regular individual-rater and
calibration intervals were withheld in those cases; their availability
was therefore 11/40 and 21/40, not 40/40. The population-SD interval
remained a separate, available target.

**Few-rater interval calibration remains unresolved.** Even with the
stated normal populations, the six-rater prediction intervals
under-covered. The four-rater demonstration above illustrates the
workflow; it is not evidence that an explicitly requested interval
achieves 95% coverage. These intervals alone should not drive rater
exclusion or formal quality classifications. Nonnormal populations,
informative assignment, missingness and other designs were not qualified
by this pilot. Numerical checks and a precise implementation of a
Laplace formula do not establish the accuracy of that approximation or
its intervals.

This interval concerns the **SD across the assumed rater population**,
not the uncertainty of any single rater and not an interval for a future
score. The profile refits fixed facets, steps and the estimated ability
SD at each proposed rater SD. A known ability SD remains fixed. It can
include zero; a log-Wald interval cannot do so. If the estimated
variance is zero, regular calibration and individual-rater intervals are
withheld. That estimate alone is not proof that all raters have exactly
the same severity. The profile may still provide a positive upper limit
when ability variance is positive. If ability variance is itself an
estimated zero boundary at the source or along the profile, the profile
stops: the additional nuisance-boundary reference has not been
qualified. No interval for ability population SD is supplied.

The cutoff uses an asymptotic chi-square likelihood-ratio rule. Boundary
asymptotics differ from ordinary interior asymptotics; the usual
one-degree cutoff is conservative under the standard single-variance
boundary conditions ([Self and Liang,
1987](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1987.10478472)). Those conditions
do not provide a finite-sample or arbitrary-design guarantee. Failed
profile checks stop the calculation instead of manufacturing limits; the
error’s `profile` field retains the numerical evaluations when a
numerical check fails.

`rater_sd = 0` has a different meaning: it **fixes a known zero
variance** and fits that submodel. Do not choose it merely because the
estimated variance is small. Likewise, fixing a positive SD assumes that
value is known, rather than propagating uncertainty from a previous
estimate.

## Compare intervals using complete model refits

[`mfrm_random_rater_intervals()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrm_random_rater_intervals.md)
provides a model-based bootstrap candidate for **observed-rater effects
relative to the population mean**. It regenerates one ability per
person, one shared effect per rater and the scores at the same analyzed
assignment. Abilities are generated with the fitted ability SD. Every
replicate refits calibration and both population SDs (each stays fixed
only if originally specified as known). Per-trial `PersonSD` and
`EstimatedPersonVarianceBoundary` retain the ability-population outcome.
It neither holds the original fitted raters fixed nor draws an
independent severity for each rating.

For each rater it retains the generated effect minus the refitted
estimate. The default divides this error by the replicate’s
calibration-adjusted prediction SE. The bootstrap tail quantiles then
multiply the original SE and are added to the original point estimate.
Keeping the **prediction error** is essential: percentiles of refitted
rater modes alone would ignore the changing true random effect. This
studentized construction is motivated by mixed-model prediction research
([Chatterjee, Lahiri and Li, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1214/07-AOS512));
their Gaussian linear-model accuracy result does not establish accuracy
for this ordinal crossed-rater model.

#> R04  -Inf   Inf
```

The default is 499 refits; larger runs improve Monte Carlo tail
resolution but do not correct a wrong model. At 95%, 19 replicates give
only 0.475 expected draws per tail. This demonstration is not an
adequate production interval analysis. The result records
`expected_tail_draws`, every replicate’s seed, generated severity,
estimate, SE and fit status. `method = "error"` provides unscaled-error
intervals from the same draws as a comparison; it is not automatically a
remedy when studentization fails.

If a bootstrap fit estimates zero variance, its ordinary rater SE is
unavailable. Its generated-minus-estimated error can still be recorded,
but its studentized error is unresolved. Failed refits are also
retained. The lower endpoint treats unresolved errors as minus infinity;
the upper endpoint treats them as plus infinity. These are outer limits
covering the empirical intervals from any completion of those unresolved
errors. When too many replicates are unresolved, a limit is unbounded.
Dropping those draws or simulating until a chosen number succeeds would
change the reference sample.

Arrows denote **unbounded** endpoints, not finite limits at the edge of
the plot. Grey ordinary intervals remain a comparison and do not replace
them. Even a bounded bootstrap interval is not automatically well
calibrated. The finite/unbounded distinction matters when reporting
coverage: an interval spanning all real numbers always covers but
provides no localization. With only 19 planned refits, even one
unresolved replicate makes both 95% endpoints unbounded under this rule.
More refits improve tail resolution, but do not remove a genuine
tendency to estimate zero variance. Inspect the trial table instead of
treating an unbounded result as a plotting error or discarding the
boundary replicate.

This procedure assesses coverage over repeated persons, rater effects
and scores under the fitted model. It does not promise conditional
coverage at every fixed true rater severity. It requires a positive
source SD and positive prediction SEs. Retain an estimated zero-variance
diagnosis. The separate rater-SD profile can describe population
variation at a rater boundary, but is unavailable at an estimated
ability-variance boundary. It does not provide familywise control, rater
contrasts or a justification for excluding raters. Omitted scores stay
omitted, so uncertainty about the missingness mechanism is not
represented. Save the bootstrap object to reuse its roots and plots
without RTMB or repeated fitting.

### What the bootstrap comparison shows

A separate comparison used **24 new datasets**, 12 per rater-count
condition, under the same 240-person, 1,440-rating normal-population
design above, with true rater SD 0.7. Ability SD was fixed as known at
one in generation, source fitting and refits; this is not evidence for
estimated ability SD. Each source had 99 planned bootstrap refits. Both
intervals were evaluated on the same dataset and realized effects; the
earlier 40-dataset results were not reused as the ordinary-interval
comparator.

| Raters | Interval | Coverage | Mean width (logits) | Finite intervals |
|---:|----|---:|---:|---:|
| 6 | Ordinary normal | 91.7% | 1.177 | 72/72 |
| 6 | Studentized bootstrap | 100.0% | 1.648 | 72/72 |
| 6 | Unscaled-error bootstrap | 90.3% | 1.227 | 72/72 |
| 24 | Ordinary normal | 95.5% | 1.122 | 288/288 |
| 24 | Studentized bootstrap | 95.1% | 1.149 | 288/288 |
| 24 | Unscaled-error bootstrap | 93.8% | 1.122 | 288/288 |

All 24 source fits and 2,376 refits passed numerical/information checks.
Two refits estimated zero variance; their unresolved studentized errors
were retained. No interval was unbounded in this comparison. Thus the
six-rater increase was not obtained by counting infinite intervals as
successes, but the mean interval was **40% wider**. Its improvement
occurred in just one of the 12 datasets. The paired coverage change was
+8.3 percentage points with MCSE 8.3 points; for 24 raters it was -0.35
points with MCSE 1.08 points. MCSEs use datasets, not individual raters,
as independent replications.

This is a small method comparison, **not coverage qualification**. The
six-rater bootstrap covered every target in every dataset, so its
empirical coverage variance is zero; that is not evidence of zero Monte
Carlo uncertainty or guaranteed coverage. Twelve datasets and 99 refits
(2.475 expected draws per 95% tail) are too few for a precise accuracy
assessment. The unscaled comparison did not improve coverage here, and
24 raters showed no clear studentized improvement. Keep the bootstrap as
an explicit comparison rather than an automatic correction or a
replacement for ordinary output. Nonnormal populations, informative
assignment and missingness remain unqualified.

## Score Persons without treating raters as known

For people already in `random_fit`, `score_mfrm_persons(random_fit)` is
the common scoring entry shared with supported ordinary and testlet
RSMs. It uses the full source rating table. The model-specific
[`score_mfrm_random_rater()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/score_mfrm_random_rater.md)
below also allows a different complete scoring table. Both estimate
abilities from responses.
[`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html) answers a different
question: response probabilities at ability values you supply.

``` r
# Keep the complete source roster; request only these output rows.
selected_persons <- as.character(unique(ratings$Person)[1:2])
person_scores <- score_mfrm_random_rater(random_fit, persons = selected_persons)

The calculation holds fitted calibration, including both population
variances, fixed. It integrates other Persons’ abilities and the jointly
uncertain shared raters, using a conditional Laplace approximation for
the raters. It normalizes a continuous marginal ability density to
obtain EAP, posterior SD and equal-tail intervals. This is not scoring
after substituting rater modes as known values, and the rater effects
are not integrated independently for each Person. The reported
`IntegrationDifference` and `InterpolationDifference` assess quadrature
and interpolation convergence. Small values do not bound the separate
rater Laplace error or guarantee repeated-calibration coverage.
Computation increases with the full roster and the number of requested
scores. Start with a few Person IDs when checking a large roster: the
default `persons = NULL` computes every posterior and can be slow.
Selecting output Persons keeps all of their peers’ responses in the
calculation.

``` r
plot(person_scores)
```

Filled points are response-based scores; open points, when present,

or `as_ggplot(plot(person_scores, draw = FALSE))` to reuse the same

rater approximation; they are not tests of Person differences or
automatic performance classifications.

If you supply `newdata`, supply the **complete joint scoring roster**.
It replaces the source responses and is not appended to them. Include
every response intended to inform the shared raters, and use `persons`
to choose which scores to return. New Person and rater IDs are allowed
under the same normal populations; fixed-facet levels must be known. To
update existing responses, replace them explicitly and include each
intended rating event once. Restricting the roster to two Persons
generally differs from requesting two outputs while retaining
everybody’s responses.

Missing assigned scores require `missing = "omit"`. An entirely
unobserved Person then retains a `prior_only` row with the population
distribution, not a measured average ability. Zero fitted ability
variance or failed numerical checks produce unavailable scores with a
reason. No score is imputed.

### How close are these scores to the joint posterior?

A numerical comparison held calibration fixed and used independent joint
posterior sampling as a reference. It covered three-category RSMs with
six or 24 raters, rotating pairs or two weakly linked panels. Eight
rosters had 240 Persons and 1,440 responses; four reduced scoring
rosters had 48 Persons and 96 responses, with the original calibration
retained. These reduced rosters had fewer collected ratings; no missing
scores were imputed. Four Persons per roster were selected, including
panel links and low/high observed totals. These 48 scores are selected
numerical cases, not independent replications for estimating coverage.

| Quantity | Numerical tolerance | Result in the selected cases |
|----|----|----|
| EAP | 0.05 logits | All 48 met the criterion with Monte Carlo uncertainty included. |
| Posterior SD | 0.05 logits | All 48 met the criterion with Monte Carlo uncertainty included. |
| Lower and upper endpoints | 0.10 logits | All 96 met the conditional-CDF bracketing criterion. |

The largest differences from the sampled reference were 0.013 logits for
EAP and 0.015 logits for posterior SD. A raw sample-quantile comparison
left 24 endpoints unresolved because of reference precision or its
uncertainty allowance. To assess those endpoints more precisely, the
same saved joint rater samples were used to integrate each Person’s
conditional ability distribution. Its averaged CDF bracketed the target
quantile within 0.10 logits of each reported endpoint, allowing for
Monte Carlo and numerical error. This reference refinement used all 48
selected Persons and changed neither the mfrmr scores nor the sampled
posterior. The original quantile results remain recorded.

The tolerances are numerical comparison criteria, not assessment cutoffs
or universal error bounds. These results support the tested conditional
scoring calculations. They do not establish 95% repeated-sampling
coverage with estimated calibration, accuracy for every sparse design,
the calibration likelihood approximation, or significance of Person
differences. The normal population and assignment assumptions still need
substantive justification.

## Distinguish an observed rater from a replacement rater

Specify abilities in logits on the fitted scale (mean zero, Rasch slope
one). An ability of one is one logit, not one population SD. This API
does not estimate abilities from new response data.

``` r
observed <- data.frame(
  Rater = "R01", Criterion = "Content", Ability = c(-1, 0, 1)
)
p_observed <- predict(random_fit, observed, ability = "Ability", rater = "observed")
replacement <- transform(observed, Rater = "New rater")
p_new <- predict(random_fit, replacement, ability = "Ability", rater = "new")
p_observed$expected_scores
#>   Row Rater Ability ExpectedScore
#> 1   1   R01      -1      2.194312
#> 2   2   R01       0      2.880652
#> 3   3   R01       1      3.430402
p_new$expected_scores
#>   Row     Rater Ability ExpectedScore
#> 1   1 New rater      -1      2.090789
#> 2   2 New rater       0      2.771726
#> 3   3 New rater       1      3.351627
p_new$probabilities
#>                1         2         3          4
#> [1,] 0.254912786 0.4426217 0.2592293 0.04323621
#> [2,] 0.064789987 0.2932003 0.4475039 0.19450584
#> [3,] 0.008748215 0.1036857 0.4147571 0.47280894
```

Observed-rater probabilities average over that rater’s approximate
conditional distribution. Replacement-rater probabilities average over
the estimated population distribution. Simply setting severity to zero
generally gives a different answer. Both calculations hold calibration
and the supplied ability fixed; they do not propagate uncertainty about
those quantities.

The returned rows are **marginal probabilities for individual ratings**.
Rows with the same new rater ID share one latent severity in the model.
Multiplying their marginal probabilities would discard that dependence.
This method does not return a joint predictive distribution, an interval
for an average rating, a scored person ability or a response imputation.

## Keep assignment and missing scores explicit

Use one row per assigned rating. Unassigned combinations remain absent.
A missing assigned score is refused by default. `missing = "omit"`
explicitly analyzes only observed scores and stores the omitted row
numbers; it does not justify ignorability or fill missing values. The
current route requires a connected Person-rater graph, multiple persons
per rater, full-rank fixed facets and every declared category observed.
Connectedness is necessary for this route but does not establish
adequate information about rater variation.

The current scope does not include PCM, anchors, informative assignment,
testlet dependence, multidimensional abilities or nonnormal rater
populations. The assigned-score MI pooling workflow and portable fixed
calibration workflow have different model contracts and cannot silently
accept these fits.

## Inspect posterior predictive residuals

For response-level residuals, uncertainty about ability and **all shared
raters** must be integrated jointly. Substituting a rater mode or using
the supplied-ability [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html)
results above would answer a different question.
[`mfrm_response_diagnostics()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrm_response_diagnostics.md)
holds calibration fixed and obtains each category’s probability from a
joint integral with a hypothetical replicate sharing the original Person
and rater. It then calculates the predictive mean and full mixture
variance.

This calculation can be expensive. The example selects all assigned
ratings for one Person for display; every observed rating in the
original fit still informs the shared-rater posterior. The resulting
rater summaries describe **only those selected rows**, not the raters’
full workloads. Omit `rows` to summarize all assigned ratings.

``` r
selected_rows <- which(ratings$Person == ratings$Person[1])
response_review <- mfrm_response_diagnostics(random_fit,
  rows = selected_rows, group_by = "Rater")
response_review$measures

The category-specific Laplace numerator integrals are normalized to
obtain a probability distribution.
`response_review$rows$NormalizationError` retains the unnormalized sum
minus one. The approximation reoptimizes the joint rater mode for each
category; fixed calibration is never refitted. Agreement between
quadrature orders and a small normalization defect do **not** prove
Laplace accuracy, particularly with few raters or sparse data. See
[`help("mfrm_response_diagnostics")`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrm_response_diagnostics.md)
for the equations and reference.

These same-data residual summaries have no established expectation of
one, ZSTD, p-values or reference cutoffs. They cannot be compared
directly with ordinary plug-in Infit/Outfit and do not classify rater
quality. Missing scores, zero/nonfinite predictive variances and
unresolved integration remain explicit; a group with an unresolved
observed row has no summary. `style = "scatter"` offers a second view;
`palette = "mono"` retains distinct symbols in the paired view. Custom
or hidden titles, notes and labels are supported, as are
[`as_ggplot()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/as_ggplot.md)
and
[`plot_data()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/plot_data.md)
without recomputation.

## Compare predictions on the same definition

Does accounting for shared rater uncertainty change expected scores and
residual summaries? Calculate the ordinary RSM’s posterior predictive
quantities, then compare them with the saved extension results. Both
models use the same observed ratings and selected events. The ordinary
plug-in indices returned by
[`diagnose_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/diagnose_mfrm.md)
have a different definition and cannot replace this step.

``` r
ordinary_response_review <- mfrm_response_diagnostics(ordinary_fit,
  rows = selected_rows, group_by = "Rater")

![Differences in descriptive posterior predictive Infit for matched
rater summaries. Zero means agreement between models, not acceptable
model
fit.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/predictive-comparison-1.png)

These differences are descriptive and hold each model’s calibration
fixed. The zero line means the summaries agree. A smaller Infit does
**not** show that the model is better or the rater is more accurate:
these predictions reuse the observations being checked, and their mean
squares have no established reference value of one. The selected
Person’s ratings alone contribute to these group summaries, while all
observed Persons inform the shared-rater posterior.

``` r
as_ggplot(model_comparison, metric = "probability", show_labels = FALSE,
  palette = "mono", show_title = FALSE, show_notes = FALSE)
```

![Paired category probabilities from the two models, one panel per score
category. The dashed diagonal marks equal probabilities; this monochrome
display has no quality
flags.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/predictive-probabilities-1.png)

Use `metric = "expected_score"`, `"variance"` or `"outfit"` to change
the quantity, and `category = 4` with `metric = "probability"` to focus
on one score. Expected scores remain on the original scale; variances
are in squared score units. `responses$rows` retains both original row
numbers and `responses$events` identifies each matched rating. Repeated
events retain their multiplicity. If one prediction is unavailable, its
difference remains missing with a reason. Group summaries never silently
discard an unresolved observed row. Row numbers can differ between fits;
matching uses event contents.

The report below saves these comparisons and supports
`plot(res, type = "response_comparison", metric = "infit")`. To collect
the ordinary model’s summaries separately without running its plug-in
diagnostics, use
`mfrm_results(ordinary_fit, response_diagnostics = ordinary_response_review, compute = "never")`.
Plotting, collecting and exporting saved comparisons performs no new
integration.

## Compare Person scores and inspect model-aware maps

How do individual scores change when the model accounts for shared
raters? Use conditional scores computed from the same complete source
roster. Selecting returned Persons does not remove the other observed
responses. The ordinary model’s scoring retains its fitted normal mean
and variance.

``` r
source_scores <- person_scores # Already scored from the complete roster
ordinary_person_scores <- score_mfrm_persons(ordinary_fit,
  persons = source_scores$table$Person)
model_comparison <- compare_mfrm(ordinary_fit, random_fit,
  response_diagnostics = list(ordinary_response_review, response_review),
  person_scores = list(ordinary_person_scores, source_scores))

![Changes in conditional Person EAPs after centering each model at its
fitted population mean. There are no model-difference confidence
intervals or significance
decisions.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/person-comparison-1.png)

The comparison subtracts each model’s fitted population mean to remove
its arbitrary origin; it preserves the Rasch logit unit. It retains raw
scores, origins, posterior SDs and conditional endpoints. Shrinkage and
population variance can still differ. Separate score intervals do not
constitute an interval for their difference, a ranking of models or a
test between Persons. Prior-only and unavailable differences remain
withheld.

``` r
map_results <- mfrm_results(random_fit, scores = source_scores,
  response_diagnostics = response_review, comparison = model_comparison)
plot(map_results, type = "wright", show_labels = TRUE)
```

![Model-aware Wright map of selected Person EAPs, conditional facet
reference locations and adjacent category boundaries. Only Person points
have conditional interval
whiskers.](mfrmr-random-raters_files/figure-html/model-wright-1.png)

The Person column shows the selected source EAPs. Facet positions equal
the severity coefficient plus the **mean step location**: the average
adjacent category boundary when other effects are zero. The category
column shows each step at that zero reference. The rater column uses
observed-rater conditional modes. It does not show replacement-rater
marginal predictions. These positions are conditional references, not
posterior-averaged category crossings. A higher reference location means
more ability is needed to cross the corresponding boundary. Adding
several plotted facet locations together would count the mean step more
than once; use the model equation for a specific rating profile.

Whiskers show only Person intervals conditional on calibration.
Translating an ordinary facet interval by the step mean would omit the
covariance and uncertainty of that mean, so no such composite interval
is drawn. The separate calibration/rater plots retain their original
uncertainty targets.

``` r
as_ggplot(plot(map_results, type = "fit_pathway", facet = "Rater",
  palette = "mono", show_title = FALSE, draw = FALSE))
```

![Rater reference locations against descriptive posterior Infit for the
selected ratings. Rater labels identify points; the monochrome plot has

This pathway connects position with the previously defined
**descriptive** posterior residual index. Here they describe only the
selected Person’s ratings, although all 768 observed source ratings
inform the shared-rater posterior. Use `fit_stat = "Outfit"` to change
the horizontal index. A large or small value is a prompt to inspect the
selected data, not a rater-quality classification. No ordinary fit
cutoff, ZSTD or automatic exclusion is supplied.

Use `facet`, `persons`, `show_steps`, `show_intervals` and `show_labels`
to select the display. `show_title = FALSE` and `show_notes = FALSE`
hide annotations while retaining their meaning in
[`plot_data()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/plot_data.md).
Shapes accompany colour; `palette = "mono"` supports grayscale output.
Tables retain unavailable rows and original/transformed coordinates.
Older saved testlet scores lacking a complete `scoring_data` roster must
be regenerated from the saved fit before these maps or score
comparisons; no refit is needed. See
[`?mfrmr_model_maps`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrmr_model_maps.md).

archive_dir <- tempfile("random-rater-report-")
archive <- export_mfrm_results(res, archive_dir, preset = "starter",
  acknowledge_sensitive = TRUE) # Synthetic example; real exports retain IDs
stopifnot(nrow(archive$plot_errors) == 0)

```

The archive’s `index.html` links to the report and available severity
plots. Bootstrap limits that extend to infinity stay infinite in the
tables and are shown with arrows in the plot. Failed or unresolved
refits remain in the trial table. The replay script reloads the RDS; run
it from the archive folder. Numerical convergence is not evidence of
model adequacy or interval coverage. Ordinary residual diagnostics and
the Shiny viewer are unavailable. The model-aware Wright and fit-pathway
routes above have their own conditional interpretation. Older
predictions without matching source metadata must be regenerated from
their saved fit before attachment; neither refitting nor a new bootstrap
is needed. The separately calculated population-SD profile below remains
in the complete saved analysis; it is not the observed-rater `intervals`
argument.

``` r
path <- tempfile(fileext = ".rds")
saveRDS(list(ratings = ratings, fit = random_fit, population_interval = sd_interval,
             person_scores = person_scores, rater_intervals = bootstrap_intervals,
             observed = p_observed, replacement = p_new), path)
saved <- readRDS(path)
stopifnot(identical(predict(saved$fit, replacement, "Ability", rater = "new"), p_new))

```

Retain the model, source data, checks, prediction inputs and separately
computed profile interval together. Earlier fixed-rater fits must be
refitted for this model; changing their class or plotting method does
not turn them into random-rater analyses.

## Compare with a fixed-rater analysis

Keep the same observed events, categories, criterion effects and ability
population. Examine how rater contrasts and predictions at common
ability values change. A fixed-rater fit centers the observed panel,
whereas the random-rater fit refers to its assumed population; raw
severity estimates can therefore have different origins. Shrinkage
toward zero is not itself evidence that the random model is more
accurate.

Setting `rater_sd = 0` removes all rater differences. It does not
recover a model with freely estimated fixed rater effects. After
integrating shared raters, persons remain dependent through those
raters, so the ordinary Person-count BIC and chi-squared
likelihood-ratio rules cannot be transferred automatically.
[`compare_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/compare_mfrm.md)
checks matched events and compares centered facet effects from one
ordinary and one extended fit. Its paired and difference views describe
changed fitted effects; they do not rank models or compare predictive
accuracy. For predictive evaluation, first decide whether the target is
another person, an existing rater or a new rater; arbitrary splits of
individual rating rows can retain shared effects across training and
evaluation.

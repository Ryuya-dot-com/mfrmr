# How often does a rater screen give the right warning?

An assessment coordinator wants to use fit statistics when giving
feedback to raters. Before choosing a warning rule, two questions
matter: how often does it warn about a rater whose ratings follow the
intended model, and how often does it detect a specified departure? A
difference in severity alone is not such a departure. A consistently
strict rater can fit a model that estimates severity.

[`mfrm_screening_performance()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrm_screening_performance.md)
summarizes flags against **known simulation truth**. It accepts outcomes
from your own generators, fitting methods and screening rules. It does
not determine which rule is appropriate or label real raters as good or
bad. In an actual assessment, unobserved rater quality cannot be
supplied as known truth simply by accepting the screen’s own verdict.

## Keep failed and incomplete trials in the planned roster

Declare the conditions, independent replications and targets before
running the study. `Affected = TRUE` means a target has the particular
departure the screen is meant to detect. Put different designs or
methods in separate conditions. Within each condition, keep the same
targets and truth labels.

This small invented example has two unaffected raters and four planned
trials:

``` r

roster <- expand.grid(Condition = "Null", Replicate = 1:4,
                     Target = c("R1", "R2"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
roster$Affected <- FALSE
results <- roster[c("Condition", "Replicate", "Target")]
results$Flag <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, NA, FALSE, NA, FALSE, NA)
performance <- mfrm_screening_performance(roster, results,
  rule = "Infit or Outfit outside [0.5, 1.5]; both raters; no exclusion/refit")
summary(performance)$by_family
#>   Condition                        Metric Targets CompleteScreens Planned
#> 1      Null Any unaffected target flagged       2               2       4
#> 2      Null   Any affected target flagged       0               0       0
#>   Available Unavailable Positive      Rate      MCSE     MCLower   MCUpper
#> 1         3           1        1 0.3333333 0.2721655 0.008403759 0.9057007
#> 2         0           0        0        NA        NA          NA        NA
#>   AllTrialsLower AllTrialsUpper
#> 1           0.25            0.5
#> 2             NA             NA
```

The family event is **at least one unaffected rater flagged** in a
trial. Trials 1 and 3 are complete negatives. Trial 2 is a known
positive because R1 was flagged, even though R2 is unavailable. Trial 4
is unresolved. Thus the conditional rate is 1/3, with 3 available
outcomes out of 4 planned trials. The realized proportion over all four
trials lies between 1/4 and 2/4. Those latter bounds describe unresolved
outcomes; they are not confidence intervals. Omitting a result row also
leaves it unavailable. Removing it from the roster would incorrectly
change the intended experiment.

``` r

plot(performance)
```

![One known positive family event among three available trials out of
four planned. The conditional rate is one third; unresolved-outcome
bounds span one quarter to one half and are not confidence
intervals.](mfrmr-screening-performance_files/figure-html/incomplete-plot-1.png)

Blue whiskers are exact binomial Monte Carlo intervals, conditional on
known outcomes. The gray segment describes unresolved outcomes. The
right column shows available/planned events. A completely unavailable
condition has no point estimate. Use
`plot(performance, scope = "target")` for individual rater rates, or
`metric = "detection"` for affected targets when the roster includes
them. `plot_data(plot(performance, draw = FALSE))$table` supplies the
unrounded values.

## Connect simulated ratings to a declared screen

This runnable example fits six small datasets generated without rater
misfit. It demonstrates the workflow, **not** an adequately precise
accuracy study. The band below is an explicit illustrative choice, not a
universal diagnostic threshold. The model allows rater severity
differences under this null.

``` r

spec <- build_mfrm_sim_spec(n_person = 60, n_rater = 4, n_criterion = 3,
                           raters_per_person = 2, assignment = "rotating")
planned <- expand.grid(Condition = "Rotating null", Replicate = 1:6,
                       Target = sprintf("R%02d", 1:4),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
planned$Affected <- FALSE
observed <- planned[c("Condition", "Replicate", "Target")]
observed$Flag <- NA

                    model = "RSM", quad_points = 31, maxit = 200)

    raters <- diagnostic$measures[diagnostic$measures$Facet == "Rater", ]
    raters <- raters[match(observed$Target[rows], raters$Level), ]
    observed[rows, c("Infit", "Outfit", "InfitZSTD", "OutfitZSTD")] <-
      raters[c("Infit", "Outfit", "InfitZSTD", "OutfitZSTD")]
    outside <- function(x) ifelse(is.finite(x), x < .5 | x > 1.5, NA)
    observed$Flag[rows] <- outside(raters$Infit) | outside(raters$Outfit)

  observed$Message[rows] <- paste(unique(messages), collapse = " | ")
}

screen <- mfrm_screening_performance(planned, observed,
  rule = paste("Infit OR Outfit outside [0.5, 1.5]; all four observed raters;",
               "computable descriptive screens retained; no exclusion/refit"))

```

R’s logical `|` retains an available positive when the other index is
missing; one negative plus one missing index remains unknown. We record
numerical readiness separately from computability. This example retains
computable descriptive screens; an inferential procedure may require a
stricter rule. Specify that rule in advance and preserve unavailable
outcomes when it fails.

Six datasets are six independent replications, even though each contains
four correlated raters. The any-rater rate therefore has a denominator
of six, not 24. With zero flags in six replications, the exact 95% upper
Monte Carlo bound is about 46%. A reported Monte Carlo standard error of
zero at a boundary is not evidence of certainty. More replications
narrow simulation uncertainty; they cannot fix an inappropriate
generator or screening rule.

To evaluate sensitivity, add a prespecified alternative that generates
the departure of interest and mark its affected targets. Inconsistency,
Rater-by-Group differential functioning and Rater-by-Criterion
interaction are different alternatives. The existing
[`evaluate_mfrm_signal_detection()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/evaluate_mfrm_signal_detection.md)
specializes in Group-by-Criterion DIF and Rater-by-Criterion interaction
bias; it does not implement a general Rater-by-Group accuracy study.

## Compare thresholds without refitting the models

Retain the actual mean squares, not just a yes/no warning. The following
profiles are declared comparisons, not an ordered scale of model
quality. The final asymmetric band is a published heuristic for judged
performance; its label does not make it a validated rater cutoff for
every assessment.

``` r

bands <- data.frame(
  Profile = c("0.5-1.5", "0.7-1.3", "0.8-1.2", "0.4-1.2"),
  Lower = c(.5, .7, .8, .4), Upper = c(1.5, 1.3, 1.2, 1.2)
)
sensitivity <- mfrm_screening_sensitivity(planned, observed, bands,
  rule = "Ordinary RSM MML; EAP plug-in residuals; all raters; no exclusion/refit")

![Directional false-flag rates across discrete threshold profiles, with

The intervals describe Monte Carlo uncertainty across independent
simulated datasets; six trials leave considerable uncertainty.
Thresholds applied to the same ratings are paired, so comparing their
interval overlap is not a paired test. `statistic = "infit"` and
`"outfit"` allow separate index comparisons. Use
`quantity = "unavailable"` to inspect unresolved family events, and
`metric = "detection"` when the roster includes affected targets.
All-trial bounds and complete counts remain in the source tables.

`palette = "mono"` avoids reliance on colour. `show_title = FALSE` and
`show_notes = FALSE` suppress annotations; `title`, `caption`,
`text_scale` and `point_size` customize presentation. Tile percentages
supplement shading, and curves use distinct symbols and line types. The
returned plot data include a text alternative. With ggplot2 installed,
use `as_ggplot(plot(sensitivity, draw = FALSE))` for further styling. If
labels are hidden for a crowded figure, provide the retained table
alongside it.

## Distinguish low mean squares from ZSTD-only warnings

[`fit_measures_table()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/fit_measures_table.md)
now uses mean squares for its default directional labels. It retains all
ZSTD columns, flags additional ZSTD-only evidence in `ZSTDOnly`, and
makes the earlier combined rule available explicitly:

``` r

review <- fit_measures_table(fit, flag_basis = "mnsq")
combined_review <- fit_measures_table(fit, flag_basis = "mnsq_or_zstd")
combined_study <- mfrm_screening_sensitivity(planned, observed, bands,
  rule = "Same saved residuals; engine ZSTD; no exclusion/refit", zstd_cut = 2)
```

Changing the mean-square band under the combined rule need not change a
ZSTD-only warning. ZSTD depends on sample size and on the df convention.
Its approximate transformation is not a calibrated 5% test after
estimating parameters or screening many raters. Compare the magnitude of
the mean square, the number of ratings, the residual basis and the
substantive consequence. A low mean square means lower residual
variability than predicted. This use of **overfit** does not mean
machine-learning overfitting, poor rater quality or misconduct. It may
reflect redundancy, dependence or fitting effects; it does not identify
their cause. Review large mean squares and the data first, and do not
automatically remove a consistent rater to make an index closer to one.

The distinction between discrepancy magnitude and standardized
significance follows [Linacre
(2003)](https://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt171n.htm). The bands summarized by
[Wright and Linacre (1994)](https://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt83b.htm) are
contextual heuristics originally discussed for item fit, not universal
error-controlled rater thresholds.

## Check the mathematical target before interpreting a threshold

For unit-weight ratings, let $`p_{ik}`$ be the declared model
probability of category score $`k`$, $`\mu_i=\sum_k k p_{ik}`$,
$`V_i=\sum_k(k-\mu_i)^2 p_{ik}`$ and $`e_i=y_i-\mu_i`$. Then

``` math
\mathrm{Outfit}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i\frac{e_i^2}{V_i},\qquad
\mathrm{Infit}=\frac{\sum_i e_i^2}{\sum_i V_i}.
```

For fixed correct probabilities with positive variances, each expected
squared residual is $`V_i`$, giving a reference expectation of one. That
calculation does not establish the sampling distribution after
estimating the model and Person scores from the same responses. Ordinary
MML diagnostics here use plug-in EAP Person estimates. Parameter fitting
and shrinkage can shift the residual summaries; response dependence also
changes uncertainty. Engine and fourth-moment df conventions do not
repair an incorrect residual target.

For an extended model integrating latent effects, the predictive
variance must retain both terms in the law of total variance:
$`V_i=E[\mathrm{Var}(Y_i\mid b)]+\mathrm{Var}(E[Y_i\mid b])`$, with
expectations taken over the specified latent distribution. Integrating
only conditional variance, or substituting rater modes, generally gives
a different statistic. Moreover, using the same responses to obtain the
latent posterior and to check fit does not give the ordinary mean-square
reference distribution. The threshold workflow above evaluates
ordinary-model screens; it does not authorize those bands for the
extended-model posterior-predictive diagnostics.

## Design an accuracy study around the feedback decision

1.  State the departure, intended warning and consequences of false
    warnings. If a procedure selects or excludes raters and refits,
    evaluate that entire procedure, including its effects on scores and
    intervals.
2.  Specify nulls and alternatives, rater counts, rubric categories,
    ability distributions and rating assignments. Compare assignments at
    matched rating budgets when asking about connectivity. Keep planned
    nonassignment separate from missing scores on assigned ratings.
3.  Fix thresholds and the comparison family before examining outcomes.
    One rater’s false-flag rate does not control the probability of any
    false flag among many raters. A union of several diagnostics changes
    the procedure.
4.  Retain all planned trials, errors and unavailable results. Choose
    the number of replications for the precision needed, and report
    Monte Carlo uncertainty. If conditions share simulated data, compare
    them with paired outcomes rather than pretending that their
    estimated rates are independent.

The tables retain full precision. Save the result and its original
inputs with `saveRDS(screen, "screening-study.rds")`; use
`write.csv(screen$by_family, "screening-family.csv", row.names = FALSE)`
for a table. These commands write to your working directory. The stored
rule records your description; it cannot verify when that rule was
chosen.

## Evidence and limits

A bounded comparison used 120 persons, six fixed raters, three criteria
and four score categories. Each person was assigned two raters: 720
planned ratings and 120 ratings per rater. A rotating cycle linked all
raters through repeated overlap. A weak-bridge design kept the same
workloads but linked two panels through only two persons. Both designs
used the same 100 independent latent and response draws per scenario.
The screen was the union of Infit and Outfit outside \[0.5, 1.5\], with
no rater exclusion or refitting.

| Generating scenario | Any unaffected rater flagged: rotating | Any unaffected rater flagged: weak bridge | Detection of affected R6: rotating / weak bridge |
|----|---:|---:|---:|
| Normal population, no inconsistency | 0/100 | 0/100 | Not applicable |
| Each R6 response replaced by a uniform category with probability 0.5 | 0/100 | 0/100 | 6/100 / 2/100 |
| Assignment by ability rank, no inconsistency | 0/100 | 0/100 | Not applicable |
| 20% of assigned scores missing completely at random | 0/100 | 1/100 | Not applicable |
| 20% missing, favoring generated scores of zero | 0/100 | 0/100 | Not applicable |

For the contaminated R6, exact 95% Monte Carlo intervals are 2.23–12.60%
in the rotating design and 0.24–7.04% with weak bridges. The paired
difference is minus 4 percentage points (MCSE 2.81 points); this small
comparison does not establish a general ordering of designs. Each 0/100
false-flag result has a 3.62% upper bound; 1/100 has an interval of
0.03–5.45%. These are pointwise intervals, not simultaneous protection
across conditions.

All 6,000 target screens were computable. Three of the 1,000 fits
required category-support review, all under score-dependent missingness:
two rotating and one weak-bridge fit. Their descriptive screens were
retained according to the declared rule; their availability is not
evidence of inference readiness. The missingness scenarios retain 576
observed ratings each. Score-dependent missingness selected exactly 144
assigned scores without replacement, with fourfold selection weight for
generated zeros. Fits used observed scores only. Ability-linked
assignment retained the same overall normal ability draws but changed
their distribution across panels. These are nulls for rater
inconsistency, not assertions that all analysis assumptions remain
correct.

**The low detection rates are a limitation of this screen under the
specified alternative.** Rare false warnings do not make a screen useful
when it misses most contaminated raters. An absence of flags cannot
certify rater quality. The study does not qualify other thresholds,
contamination strengths, rater counts, PCM/GPCM models, disconnected
designs, differential rater functioning, post-selection inference or
missing-score imputation. Thresholds were not retuned to these outcomes.
The study reused 200 unchanged pre-selection screens and fitted the
other 800 datasets; the reused results are not extra independent
replications.

## Stress-test thresholds, sample size and low-side warnings

A further bounded study compared five declared bands, Infit and Outfit
separately and jointly, and mean-square-only versus mean-square-or-ZSTD
rules. Each condition used 100 independent replications, categories 0–3,
three criteria and an ordinary fixed-rater RSM fitted by MML with 61
quadrature points. Abilities were generated from the assumed standard
normal population. Rater severities were equally spaced from -0.8 to
0.8, criterion effects were (-0.3, 0, 0.3), and the shared adjacent
steps were (-1, 0, 1). The study retained computable descriptive screens
without excluding fits that required inference review. It did not remove
raters or refit after screening.

| Condition | Persons / raters | Generating feature |
|----|----|----|
| Small crossed null | 60 / 6 | Every person rated by every rater |
| Short sparse null | 60 / 6 | Two raters per person, rotating overlap |
| Large sparse null | 600 / 6 | Same six ratings per person; more persons per rater |
| Twelve-rater null | 120 / 12 | Two raters per person, rotating overlap |
| Heavy MCAR null | 120 / 6 | Exactly 60% of the 720 assigned scores missing at random |
| Random R6 | 120 / 6 | Each R6 response independently replaced by a uniform category with probability 0.5 |
| Predictable R6 | 120 / 6 | Each R6 response replaced by its model-modal category with probability 0.75 |
| Local dependence | 120 / 6 | A normal Person-by-rater effect with SD 1 shared across three criteria |
| Disconnected null | 120 / 6 | Two rater panels with no common persons; common criteria and ability-population assumption retained |

Except for the crossed condition, each person was assigned two raters
and three criteria. Nonassigned cells were absent, not imputed. The
nulls permit severity differences. The disconnected condition is null
for rater response inconsistency; it does not qualify cross-panel
interpretation when the assumed ability distributions differ. Local
dependence affects all raters and cannot be interpreted as identifying
one bad rater.

The following are **any-unaffected-rater overfit rates**, not
individual-rater probabilities. Mean squares use \[0.5, 1.5\]; the
combined rule also uses engine ZSTD at or below -2 for the low-side
flag.

| Null condition      | Mean squares only | Mean squares or ZSTD |
|---------------------|------------------:|---------------------:|
| Small crossed       |             0/100 |               44/100 |
| Short sparse        |             1/100 |               59/100 |
| Large sparse        |             0/100 |              100/100 |
| Twelve raters       |             1/100 |               88/100 |
| Heavy MCAR          |            24/100 |               92/100 |
| Disconnected panels |             0/100 |               93/100 |

Thus ZSTD-only additions can produce frequent low-side warnings even
under the generating null. The fourth-moment df convention did not
resolve this: its corresponding rates were 48%, 71%, 100%, 96%, 96% and
96%. Mean-square-only screening also remained unreliable in the
heavy-missingness condition. For 24/100, the exact pointwise 95% Monte
Carlo interval is 16.02–33.57%; for 0/100 it is 0–3.62%, and for 100/100
it is 96.38–100%. None is a universal error guarantee.

![Overfit family false-flag rates in six null conditions across five
threshold bands. Mean-square-only rates rise sharply as the lower bound
increases. Adding engine ZSTD yields 44 to 100 percent false flags under
the 0.5 to 1.5 band. Cell counts are known outcomes out of 100 planned
trials; inference-review fits are
retained.](figures/screening-overfit-stress.png)

Narrowing a band improved detection of the random-category departure but
also increased low-side false flags. The R6 detection rates were 2%,
11%, 39% and 65% under \[0.5,1.5\], \[0.6,1.4\], \[0.7,1.3\] and
\[0.8,1.2\]. Under \[0.4,1.2\], random-category detection was also 65%,
but detection of the specified predictable-response departure fell to
18%, compared with 65% under \[0.5,1.5\]. No single band was selected as
best from these outcomes. The chosen departure, the cost of false
feedback and the observation design all matter.

![R6 detection curves show the tradeoff between thresholds and
departures, with pointwise Monte Carlo intervals. Uniform-category
contamination produces upper-side flags; modal-category replacement
produces lower-side flags. A 0.4 to 1.2 band detects 65 percent of the
former and 18 percent of the
latter.](figures/screening-detection-stress.png)

All 900 fits were numerically ready and all 6,000 target screens were
computable, while 159 fits required inference review. Computability is
not inferential eligibility. Independent reconstruction from
observation-level residuals agreed with the reported mean squares to
within $`2.6\times10^{-15}`$. Nevertheless, in the large sparse null,
the average fitted Infit/Outfit was 0.832/0.806, versus 1.001/1.001
using the generating parameters. In the heavy MCAR null, the
corresponding values were 0.704/0.689 versus 1.002/1.004. The formulas
can therefore be implemented correctly while a reference rule centered
at one is unsuitable for the fitted residuals. This comparison does not
isolate every contribution of estimation, shrinkage and short Person
records; it establishes the need to validate the actual diagnostic
procedure.

The previous matched-budget study also supplied 800 saved raw-statistic
fits for threshold sensitivity without refitting. Two other cells
retained only yes/no flags, so their 200 trials remain unavailable for
new thresholds; the old flags cannot reconstruct unknown mean squares.
These reanalyses are not new independent replications. The stress
results do not qualify JML, other models, arbitrary sample sizes,
extended-model posterior diagnostics, or automatic rater exclusion.

The Monte Carlo reporting principles follow Morris, White and Crowther
(2019), [Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical
methods](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8086). Rater misfit and
differential functioning should be distinguished when designing an
evaluation; see Wind and Guo (2019), [Exploring the Combined Effects of
Rater Misfit and Differential Rater Functioning in Performance
Assessments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488921/). Incomplete
assignments are also part of the design question; see Wind and Jones
(2019), [The Effects of Incomplete Rating Designs in Combination With
Rater Effects](https://doi.org/10.1111/jedm.12201).

A warning supports review of rubric use, shared rating examples and
design coverage. It does not establish that a particular rater should be
removed, that training will help, or that an imputation method repairs
selective nonresponse. Conditions outside an evaluated generator remain
unqualified.

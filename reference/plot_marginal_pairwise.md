# Plot strict pairwise local-dependence follow-up using base R

Plot strict pairwise local-dependence follow-up using base R

## Usage

``` r
plot_marginal_pairwise(
  x,
  diagnostics = NULL,
  metric = c("exact", "adjacent"),
  top_n = 20,
  facet = NULL,
  main = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  label_angle = 45,
  preset = c("standard", "publication", "compact", "monochrome"),
  draw = TRUE,
  title = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Output from
  [`fit_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/fit_mfrm.md)
  or
  [`diagnose_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/diagnose_mfrm.md).

- diagnostics:

  Optional output from
  [`diagnose_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/diagnose_mfrm.md)
  when `x` is `mfrm_fit`.

- metric:

  `"exact"` or `"adjacent"`.

- top_n:

  Maximum level pairs shown.

- facet:

  Optional facet name used to keep only matching pairwise rows.

- main:

  Compatibility title argument. Omitted or `NULL` keeps the default
  title. Existing calls remain supported without a deprecation warning.
  For new code, prefer `title`; do not supply both arguments.

- palette:

  Optional named color overrides. Recognized names: `ok`, `flag`.

- label_angle:

  X-axis label angle.

- preset:

  Visual preset (`"standard"`, `"publication"`, `"compact"`, or
  `"monochrome"`).

- draw:

  If `TRUE`, draw with base graphics.

- title:

  Plot title. Omit it to keep the default, supply one character string
  to replace it, or use `NULL` (or `""`) to suppress it. This changes
  only the heading; numerical results, reference lines, subtitles and
  interpretation notes remain. Both `main` and `title` explicitly
  supplied is an error, even if equal or `NULL`. Positional legacy
  arguments retain their order; use the exact name `title`.

## Value

A plotting-data object of class `mfrm_plot_data`.

## Details

This helper visualizes the strict pairwise local-dependence follow-up
derived from posterior-integrated expected exact and adjacent agreement.

The `"exact"` view ranks level pairs by the absolute exact-agreement
standardized residual. The `"adjacent"` view uses the adjacent-agreement
standardized residual instead. Both are exploratory corroboration
screens for strict marginal-fit flags. Selection uses all pairs within
the requested facet, not a preselected list for the other metric.
`retention` counts available/unavailable metric values, while
`full_table` retains all candidates. Grey bars/labels indicate
unavailable values or classifications.

## Interpreting output

- Positive bars mean the observed agreement exceeded the
  posterior-expected agreement for that level pair.

- Negative bars mean the observed agreement fell below the
  posterior-expected agreement.

- Red bars indicate an available standardized-residual or agreement-gap
  rule was crossed. A missing companion rule does not cancel a known
  crossing. These are descriptive cutoffs without calibrated error
  rates.

## Typical workflow

1.  Fit with
    [`fit_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/fit_mfrm.md)
    using `method = "MML"` for `RSM` / `PCM`.

2.  Run
    [`diagnose_mfrm()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/diagnose_mfrm.md)
    with `diagnostic_mode = "both"`.

3.  Use `plot_marginal_pairwise()` to inspect level pairs behind
    pairwise local-dependence flags.

4.  Corroborate with legacy diagnostics, design review, and substantive
    interpretation before making claims.

[mfrmr_visual_diagnostics](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/mfrmr_visual_diagnostics.md)
and
[`vignette("mfrmr-visual-diagnostics", package = "mfrmr")`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/articles/mfrmr-visual-diagnostics.md).

## Session plot defaults

Set `options(mfrmr.plot_preset = "publication")` to choose a session
default for plotting functions that expose the common `preset` argument.
The supported values are `"standard"`, `"publication"`, `"compact"` and
`"monochrome"`. Precedence is an explicit call argument, then the
session option, then `"standard"`. For example, `preset = "standard"`
overrides a session set to `"monochrome"`. Explicit `preset = NULL`
retains the earlier package-default behavior; it does not read the
session option. Invalid session values cause an error only when that
option is needed.

The category-curve, data-quality, fit-review, connectivity and network
routes of [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) for
report bundles use the same option through `...`. Plots without a common
`preset` argument, including extended-model plots with their own
`palette` controls, keep their own settings. This option selects a
preset, not a universal theme or a guarantee that all renderers
implement every appearance control identically.

New plot payloads retain the resolved preset for supported saved-data
rendering. Converting an existing payload with
[`as_ggplot()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/as_ggplot.md)
uses its saved appearance, even after the session option changes. A call
that creates a new plot from a fit or statistical result uses the
current default. For a reproducible script, supply `preset` explicitly
or set the option in that script. Saving only the fitted model does not
save a session option. No global ggplot theme is changed.

Restore previous settings with
`old <- options(mfrmr.plot_preset = "monochrome")` followed by
`options(old)`. Use `options(mfrmr.plot_preset = NULL)` to remove the
option. The preset changes appearance, not estimates, confidence levels
or diagnostic thresholds.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
# Load the package and example ratings
library(mfrmr)
toy <- load_mfrmr_data("example_operational")

# Fit the model
fit <- fit_mfrm(
  data = toy,
  person = "Person",
  facets = c("Rater", "Criterion"),
  score = "Score",
  method = "MML",
  model = "RSM"
)

# Compute diagnostics once for the following checks
diagnostics <- diagnose_mfrm(fit)

# Which pairs show more or less exact agreement than the model expects?
plot_marginal_pairwise(diagnostics)

# These are screening results; inspect the rating design before drawing conclusions

# Optional: agreement within one score category
plot_marginal_pairwise(diagnostics, metric = "adjacent")

# }
```

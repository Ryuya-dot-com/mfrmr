# Plot the pairwise nesting index matrix

Renders the directed nesting index \\1 - H(B \mid A)/H(B)\\ as a heatmap
between facet pairs, highlighting fully nested relationships close to 1.
Colour scale runs from 0 (crossed, white / cold) to 1 (fully nested,
dark).

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'mfrm_facet_nesting'
plot(x, preset = c("standard", "publication", "compact", "monochrome"), ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An `mfrm_facet_nesting` object.

- preset:

  Plot preset.

- ...:

  Reserved.

## Value

Invisibly, the matrix rendered.

## Session plot defaults

Set `options(mfrmr.plot_preset = "publication")` to choose a session
default for plotting functions that expose the common `preset` argument.
The supported values are `"standard"`, `"publication"`, `"compact"` and
`"monochrome"`. Precedence is an explicit call argument, then the
session option, then `"standard"`. For example, `preset = "standard"`
overrides a session set to `"monochrome"`. Explicit `preset = NULL`
retains the earlier package-default behavior; it does not read the
session option. Invalid session values cause an error only when that
option is needed.

The category-curve, data-quality, fit-review, connectivity and network
routes of [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) for
report bundles use the same option through `...`. Plots without a common
`preset` argument, including extended-model plots with their own
`palette` controls, keep their own settings. This option selects a
preset, not a universal theme or a guarantee that all renderers
implement every appearance control identically.

New plot payloads retain the resolved preset for supported saved-data
rendering. Converting an existing payload with
[`as_ggplot()`](https://ryuya-dot-com.github.io/mfrmr/reference/as_ggplot.md)
uses its saved appearance, even after the session option changes. A call
that creates a new plot from a fit or statistical result uses the
current default. For a reproducible script, supply `preset` explicitly
or set the option in that script. Saving only the fitted model does not
save a session option. No global ggplot theme is changed.

Restore previous settings with
`old <- options(mfrmr.plot_preset = "monochrome")` followed by
`options(old)`. Use `options(mfrmr.plot_preset = NULL)` to remove the
option. The preset changes appearance, not estimates, confidence levels
or diagnostic thresholds.
